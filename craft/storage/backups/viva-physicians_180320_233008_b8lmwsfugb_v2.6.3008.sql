VIVA’s hot topics for 2018 include complications management, critical limb ischemia, pharmacotherapy, a special session on disruptive technologies, and more.</p>\n<p>As VIVA Physicians Board President Dr. John Kaufman notes, “It’s difficult for a practitioner to sift through new information to understand what’s important. VIVA is structured to provide you with that analysis, that critical view of the data and information, in a compact way from multiple specialists.” VIVA’s faculty and attendees provide representation from interventional cardiology, interventional radiology, vascular and cardiothoracic surgery, and vascular medicine. The benefit of this is that “you won’t get just the party line from one group of individuals,” Kaufman says. “You’ll hear from everybody in a distilled manner—what’s important and what you need to know going forward.”</p>\n<p>VIVA offers vascular medicine practitioners of all levels a chance to interact with speakers and attendees through a variety of educational formats. For fellows and physicians-in-training there are presentations on finding and succeeding in a first job, the importance of achieving an optimal work-life balance, and guidance on making contributions in the field.</p>\n<p>Additionally, attendees can leverage the power of the Virtual VIVA app to interact with faculty, view live cases, and review presentations. VIVA uses innovative technology to bring “the newest, latest, and greatest information to practitioners across the spectrum,” says Dr. Joshua Beckman, VIVA Physicians board member. “We are agnostic to your specialty type, but we are particular to your specialty ability.”</p>\n<p>VIVA will be held November 5-8, 2018, at the Wynn Las Vegas.

 ('91', '91', 'en_us', 'There is a Lot More to Know About Managing Pulmonary Emboli', '<p><strong>Michael R. Jaff, DO, and Kenneth Rosenfield, MD</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Vascular Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston</strong></p>\n<p>We know a lot about pulmonary emboli (PE). We know that that, though the risk for PE increases with each decade over the age of 40 (1), there is no adult patient population that is immune to the potentially devastating manifestations of PE. From a recent review of the risk of venous thromboemboli during or following prolonged air travel, we know that patients with one or more risk factors for PE should wear graduated compression stockings, avoid dehydration and be considered for pharmacoprophylaxis (2).</p>\n<p>From the guidelines of our medical societies, we have recommendations for treatment of PE in many scenarios. For example, the American College of Chest Physicians recently updated its guidelines to recommend systemic thrombolytic therapy over catheter-based therapy for patients with only PE and hypotension (3), and the European Society of Cardiology recommends “primary reperfusion” for the treatment of PE patients at high- and intermediate-high risk (4). Recent data support the use of systemic thrombolytic therapy for PE (5). We’ve learned so much that today there is little debate about the management of hemodynamically stable, minimally symptomatic PE patients. For these patients, the only controversy is which anticoagulant is most appropriate.</p>\n<p>So, yes, we know a lot. Unfortunately, there’s a lot we still need to learn.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://viva365.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/PERT-2015.jpg\" class=\"image-popup\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-511 aligncenter\" src=\"http://viva365.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/PERT-2015-1024x680.jpg\" alt=\"PERT 2015\" width=\"746\" height=\"495\" style=\"margin:10px auto 20px;padding:6px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;border-color:rgb(226,226,226);height:auto;clear:both;\" /></a></p>\n<p>For starters, we don’t know the best treatment for “submassive” or “massive” PE. The options for treating these patients are almost as numerous as the opinions of the specialists who contribute to managing these conditions. We know about the challenges: bleeding risk; the often devastating impact of PE on long-term survival; the costs associated with advanced PE therapies; and that our institutions, many of them already stretched thin, struggle to identify patients who might have PE and then to perform rapid and definitive tests and treatments for those who present during “off-hours.”</p>\n<p>From our successes with acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) and stroke teams, we know that the key to successfully reducing morbidity and mortality from PE likely lies in learning how to improve our systems so that we rapidly deploy the right team of providers at the right time. Pulmonary Embolus Response Teams (PERT) have been described as a means to achieve that goal (6), and data regarding patient management within an institution offering care through such teams has been published (7).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://viva365.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Pert-2015-2.jpg\" class=\"image-popup\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-510 aligncenter\" src=\"http://viva365.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Pert-2015-2-1024x680.jpg\" alt=\"Pert 2015 2\" width=\"746\" height=\"495\" style=\"margin:10px auto 20px;padding:6px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;border-color:rgb(226,226,226);height:auto;clear:both;\" /></a></p>\n<p>However, as skeptics have suggested, we don’t know enough about the costs of running PERT programs. We don’t yet know if risks ensue when such programs are dominated by specialists who perform PE interventions. Despite the demonstrated benefits of acute stroke and STEMI teams, we don’t yet have enough data to confirm the value of PERT programs.</p>\n<p>Again, there’s a lot we don’t know, and therefore, there’s a lot for us to debate. If you manage PE patients, please join us at the Massachusetts General Fireman Vascular CME Symposium on Pulmonary Embolism on June 28-29, 2016. There, you will see world-renowned experts coming come together to examine what we know and what we don’t know, and to debate the knowledge gaps and how best to fill them.</p>\n<p>Yes, there’s a lot we don’t know about this all-too-common and potentially deadly condition. Let’s change that. Visit <a href=\"http://www.pertconsortium.org/\">www.pertconsortium.org</a>.</p>\n<h2>REFERENCES</h2>\n<ol><li>Raskob GE, Angchaisuksiri P, Blanco AN, et al.

Such data does not exist regarding VTE. As part of its label, edoxaban carries a boxed warning stating that edoxaban should not be used  in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients with creatinine clearance greater than 95 ml/min for the prevention of stroke.</li><li>For the treatment of VTE, edoxaban is only approved after a parenteral agent has been administered for 5-10 days.</li></ul>\n<p>The approval for the use of edoxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation is based on the <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1310907\">ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study</a> of 21,105 participants, published in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> in November 2013.  This trial compared two doses of edoxaban to warfarin and revealed that the higher dose of edoxaban was non inferior to warfarin in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, 1.18% and 1.5%, respectively. Edoxaban demonstrated significantly less major bleeding and lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage compared to warfarin. However, there was a significant increase in gastrointestinal bleeding events with edoxaban versus warfarin.</p>\n<p>The recommended dose of edoxaban for non-valvular atrial fibrillation is 60 mg once daily. Creatinine clearance should be assessed before initiating therapy with edoxaban.  In patients with creatinine clearance between 15 ml/min and 50 ml/min, the dose should be reduced to 30 mg daily.  It is important to note that edoxaban has not been studied in patients with mechanical heart valves or moderate or severe mitral stenosis, and therefore, it is not recommended in these patients.  As with any anticoagulant, the premature discontinuation of edoxaban in the absence of alternative anticoagulation can increase the risk of ischemic events.</p>\n<p>The approval for use in venous thromboembolism patients was based on the <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1306638\">Hokusai venous thromboembolism study</a> published in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> in October 2013. This study randomized 8,292 patients with DVT or PE to receive warfarin or edoxaban. Edoxaban was non-inferior to warfarin in reducing the rates of recurrent VTE, 3.2% versus 3.5%, respectively.  Edoxaban was also associated with a significant decrease in the primary safety outcome of first or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding compared to warfarin, 8.5% vs 10.3%, respectively (p=0.004).   For patients with normal renal function, the recommended dose of edoxaban is 60 mg once daily following 5-10 days of a parenteral anticoagulant. For patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 mL/min and 50 mL/min, who weigh less than or equal to 60 kg, or who are on concomitant p-glycoprotein inhibitors, the recommended dose of edoxaban is 30 mg once daily following a parenteral anticoagulant.</p>\n<p>Two important points were noted as part of the Hokusai-VTE study that may set edoxaban apart from other new oral anticoagulants:</p>\n<ul><li>Use of a parenteral agent. Because the Hokusai-VTE trial included a run-in phase with a parenteral agent (unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin), edoxaban is not approved without the use of a parenteral agent for the first 5-10 days.  This is in contrast to both <a href=\"http://www.xareltohcp.com/sites/default/files/pdf/xarelto_0.pdf\">rivaroxaban</a> and <a href=\"http://packageinserts.bms.com/pi/pi_eliquis.pdf\">apixaban</a>, two other oral Xa inhibitors.</li><li>Use in severe pulmonary embolism. While rivaroxaban, apixaban and dabigatran have been poorly studied in the setting of high-risk pulmonary embolism, there is some data to suggest that edoxaban is effective in this subset of patients. RV dysfunction was found in over 34% in both the edoxaban and warfarin groups.  The authors speculated that the run-in with a parenteral agent encouraged clinicians to enroll patients with severe VTE edoxaban more frequently than in the other novel oral anticoagulant studies</li><li>Less clinically relevant bleeding than warfarin. There was a signal that showed superiority for clinically relevant bleeding (major and minor). This signal did not exist for the analysis examining major bleeding alone. A <a href=\"http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/131/1/82.full.pdf\">small phase I trial</a>published in January 2015 in <em>Circulation</em> showed that bleeding measures could be reversed by administration of 4 factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) in patients who received edoxaban. A <a href=\"http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/124/15/2450.full-text.pdf+html\">meta-analysis</a> showed that novel oral anticoagulants in general are associated with less bleeding than warfarin including less intra-cranial bleeding. This meta-analysis did not comment about edoxaban in particular. In a <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1411800\">Phase I study</a>, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in Nov 2014, PER977 (Perosphere), a small, synthetic, water-soluble, cationic molecule designed to bind specifically to unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin has shown promise as a reversal agent and is being investigated in ongoing Phase II trials.</li></ul>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2018-02-04 22:28:55', '2018-02-15 17:48:03', 'b1f2a364-aff8-4c01-8039-b4a086807a75'),

Marianne Brodmann, M.D., of the Medical University of Graz in Austria, presented the data today as a late-breaking trial at the Vascular Interventional Advances (<a href=\"http://vivaphysicians.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">VIVA 17</a>) Annual Conference. </p>\n<p>The ILLUMENATE EU RCT, which is part of a series of five trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of Stellarex for superficial femoral artery and popliteal disease, includes 328 PAD patients from 18 centers across Germany and Austria and compares the Stellarex DCB to an uncoated angioplasty balloon. The results show that at 24 months, 75.9% of patients treated with Stellarex maintained blood flow through the treated segment of the diseased artery, assessed through blinded core-lab adjudicated patency. Only 61.0% of patients treated with an uncoated balloon still maintained blood flow at 24 months. The data shows that Stellarex demonstrates higher efficacy and patency results, and longer treatment durability compared to an uncoated balloon, which is the current standard of care in the United States.</p>\n<p>\"The Stellarex DCB produced durable results in this rigorous trial, validating earlier findings among the ILLUMENATE trial series,\" stated Marianne Brodmann, M.D. \"These consistent, top-tier outcomes are achieved with a low-dose balloon.* Stellarex is the first low-dose DCB to demonstrate a significant treatment effect at two years.\"</p>\n<p>The ILLUMENATE EU RCT has independent evaluation including supervision by a clinical events committee, a data safety and monitoring board, and assessment by angiographic and duplex ultrasound core laboratories. Philips Spectranetics fully funded the ILLUMENATE EU RCT as part of the ILLUMENATE series of five trials to evaluate the benefits of Stellarex .035\" for various patient groups in comparison to an uncoated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon, which is the current endovascular standard of care. </p>\n<p>\"We are committed to providing proven clinical solutions that positively impact patient outcomes,\" stated Christopher Barys, Image Guided Therapy Devices Business Leader for Philips. \"We are proud to have the only low-dose drug-coated balloon with a proven treatment effect at two years compared to the current endovascular standard of care in the U.S. The addition of Stellarex in the Philips portfolio through the Spectranetics acquisition reinforces our commitment to helping physicians decide, guide, treat and confirm the right therapy for their patients.\"</p>\n<p>The Stellarex drug-coated balloon is designed to restore and maintain blood flow to arteries in patients with peripheral arterial disease.

Full summaries can be found at <a href=\"http://viva.vporoom.com/trial-results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">viva.vporoom.com</a>:</p>\n<p><strong>First Prospective Multicenter Study Evaluating Outcomes Following EVAR in Women vs Men: Early Results From the LUCY Study <br /></strong>Presented by Jennifer Ash, M.D. <br />The LUCY study is the first prospective multicenter study to assess outcomes in women compared to men treated with the Ovation stent graft system (Endologix) for elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The 30-day results of the 76 women and 149 men enrolled show that compared to men, women had more complex anatomy. Technical success was achieved in 100% of the women and 98.6% of the men. No women underwent a secondary intervention for endoleak, occlusion/stenosis, or migration compared to two reinterventions in the male arm for type Ia endoleak. The early results of the LUCY study show that women derive similar benefits with the Ovation system compared to men.</p>\n<p><strong>Six-Month Results of the PREVEIL Early Feasibility Study for the SurVeil DCB <br /></strong>Presented by Gary Ansel, M.D. <br />PREVEIL is a prospective, United States, multicenter, single-arm trial to assess the safety and feasibility of the SurVeil drug-coated balloon (DCB) (Surmodics) in the treatment of subjects with de novo lesions of the femoropopliteal artery. The study enrolled 13 patients at three clinical sites with symptomatic femoropopliteal lesions ≤ 90 mm in length. Acute success measures of safety were achieved in 100% of subjects. At 6 months, subjects treated with the SurVeil DCB demonstrated primary patency of 100% and mean late lumen loss of 0.27 ± 0.54 mm. Subjects experienced significant improvement in Rutherford classification, ankle-brachial/toe-brachial index, 6-minute walk test, and walking impairment questionnaire at 30 days and 6 months. Median plasma concentration peaked immediately postprocedure (Cmax 1.07 ng/mL) and was undetectable at 30 days. Secondary technical, device, and procedural success criteria were achieved. </p>\n<p><strong>The PRELUDE Study: Prospective Study for the Treatment of Atherosclerotic Lesions in the Superficial Femoral and/or Popliteal Arteries Using the Serranator Device <br /></strong>Presented by Marianne Brodmann, M.D. <br />This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of the Serranator Alto percutaneous transluminal angioplasty serration balloon catheter (Cagent Vascular) in subjects with atherosclerotic disease of the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. The device has four external metal serrated strips embedded on a semicompliant balloon to create multiple longitudinal lines of interrupted microserrations to aid arterial expansion. Subjects with stenosis &gt; 70%, lesion length ≤ 10 cm, and reference vessel diameters of 4 to 6 mm were included. Occlusions were allowed up to 6 cm in length. The primary safety endpoint was a composite of major adverse events plus perioperative death 30-days postprocedure. The primary efficacy endpoint is defined by device success with a final diameter stenosis &lt; 50%. Twenty-five patients were enrolled at four study centers. The average pretreatment stenosis was 88% with a posttreatment stenosis of 23%. Only one stent was placed (4%) post-Serranator. There were no major adverse events or perioperative deaths at 30 days. </p>\n<p><strong>Use of a DCB to Treat Obstructive Lesions in the Superficial Femoral and Popliteal Arteries: Preliminary Results from the SAFE-DCB Trial <br /></strong>Presented by Edward Woo, M.D. <br />SAFE-DCB is a prospective, United States multicenter study designed to assess the on-label use of the Lutonix 035 DCB catheter (Bard Peripheral Vascular) for the treatment of de novo or restenotic lesions in the native superficial femoral or popliteal arteries in a real-world patient population. A total of 968 patients at 74 centers fulfilled all the study requirements. This per-protocol group had symptoms of intermittent claudication or critical limb ischemia, obstructive lesions up to 150 mm in length, and reference vessel diameters of 4 to 7 mm. To date, 627 per-protocol patients have reached the 12-month follow-up, and all evaluable 12-month data are included in this analysis. An early look at the primary endpoints showed the 30-day freedom from safety events was 98.5%, while 12-month freedom from target lesion revascularization was 90.8%. </p>\n<p><strong>First-in-Human Experience With Endovascular Aneurysm Repair Using the Ovation Alto Stent Graft <br /></strong>Presented by Sean Lyden, M.D. <br />This case review evaluated the first-in-human experience with the newest-generation Ovation stent graft, the Ovation Alto (Endologix), intended to accommodate the widest range of anatomies for on-label endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) compared to other commercially available devices. Described in the review are the first seven patients treated with the Ovation Alto stent graft at a single center from August 2016 to February 2017. The ability of the Ovation Alto to fundamentally expand EVAR indications mainly relate to the unique sealing mechanism and the delivery system. Ovation Alto was successfully delivered and deployed in all patients with 100% technical success. At 30-day follow-up, no type I or III endoleaks, stent graft migrations, abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, abdominal aortic aneurysm–related mortality, or secondary intervention were reported. </p>\n<p><strong><em>About VIVA Physicians <br /></em></strong><em>VIVA Physicians strive to be the premier educators in the field of vascular medicine and intervention.

Full summaries can be found at <a href=\"http://viva.vporoom.com/trial-results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">viva.vporoom.com</a>:</p>\n<p><b>Comparison of Particulate Embolization After Femoral Artery Treatment with IN.PACT Admiral, Ranger, and Stellarex DCBs in Healthy Swine <br /></b>Presented by Aloke Finn, M.D. <br />Different combinations of carrier excipients and drug crystallinity unique to individual drug-coated balloons (DCBs) may influence embolic safety characteristics in peripheral vascular territories through embolization of released particulates. This has the potential to cause damage to nontarget tissues downstream of the treated area. A comparator study of three DCBs (3x dosing) in healthy swine was performed to assess the vascular response of the treated vessel and nontarget tissues (embolic effects) at 28 days. Paclitaxel was detected in downstream tissues for all DCBs and followed a similar trend.</p>\n<p><b>CAS Benefit: Subgroup Analysis of ACT 1 <br /></b>Presented by Gary Ansel, M.D.  <br />The ACT I clinical trial, a prospective, multicenter, randomized study to support the approval of the Xact rapid exchange carotid stent system (Abbott Vascular) in conjunction with Emboshield embolic protection systems (Abbott Vascular) in the treatment of standard carotid endarterectomy (CEA) risk, asymptomatic extracranial carotid atherosclerotic disease subjects. The current analysis evaluates the performance of carotid artery stenting (CAS) versus CEA out to 5 years in the subgroups of gender (212 women and 278 men) and different atherosclerotic disease burdens. Carotid plus coronary artery disease plus peripheral artery disease was the only subgroup in which patients treated with CAS versus CEA had a higher freedom from death, stroke, or myocardial infarction within 30 days or ipsilateral stroke between 31 days and 5 years and a higher freedom from ipsilateral stroke between 31 days and 5 years. In select subgroups of ACT I, CAS treatment resulted in fewer long-term clinical events at 5 years compared to CEA. </p>\n<p><b>MarrowStim PAD Kit for the Treatment of Critical Limb Ischemia in Subjects with Severe PAD: 24-Month Results from the MOBILE Trial <br /></b>Presented by John Laird, M.D. <br />The phase 3 MOBILE multicenter study sought to determine if autologous bone marrow–derived progenitor cells (MarrowStim, Zimmer Biomet) could decrease major amputation in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). This is the first phase 3 trial in the United States to study bone marrow cell therapy for CLI. There were 152 patients enrolled at 24 sites. The rationale and design of this trial was based on a previous phase 1 trial and used a 3:1 treatment-to-placebo randomization scheme. At 24 months, 71 patients were eligible for analysis. Amputation-free survival was 73.6% in the MarrowStim arm and 50% in the control arm. Cell therapy appears to be durable through 24 months and improved amputation-free survival rates compared to placebo, although analysis is limited by sample size. </p>\n<p><b>ILLUMENATE European Randomized Trial: Two-Year Results <br /></b>Presented by Marianne Brodmann, M.D. <br />The ILLUMENATE European trial was conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the 0.035-inch Stellarex DCB (Spectranetics Corporation) for femoropopliteal revascularization. In total, 294 patients were randomized to treatment with the Stellarex DCB or an uncoated PTA balloon at 18 sites in Europe. Patients treated with the DCB maintained a significantly higher primary patency rate of 75.9% versus 61%. In conjunction with the higher patency rate, the rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization was significantly lower in the DCB group (12.1% vs 30.5%). Functional outcomes, such as walking impairment questionnaire scores and walking distance, were similar between groups despite there being 60% fewer revascularizations in the DCB group.</p>\n<p><b>Five-year EVAR Outcomes are Equivalent Between Genders: Results from the ENGAGE Registry <br /></b>Presented by Mark L. Schermerhorn, M.D. <br />This study compared gender-specific outcomes after endovascular aneurysm repair from a large global registry. There were 133 women (10.5%) and 1,130 men (89.5%) with infrarenal aneurysms treated with the Endurant stent graft (Medtronic) enrolled and followed clinically and radiographically. Women in the registry were older and had smaller aneurysms, narrower proximal aortic neck diameters, shorter nonaneurysmal aortic neck lengths, greater infrarenal angulation, and smaller bilateral iliac artery diameters. Successful delivery and deployment of the Endurant stent graft was achieved in equal numbers of women and men. Through 5 years, there were no aneurysm-related mortalities or ruptures in women; and the rate of freedom from secondary endovascular procedures was similar between the two genders (women, 85.6%; men, 84.1%). At 5 years, the combined rate of abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter stability and shrinkage was similar between genders (women, 89.6%; men, 89.4%). </p>\n<p><b>About VIVA Physicians <br /></b><i>VIVA Physicians strive to be the premier educators in the field of vascular medicine and intervention.

Full summaries can be found at <a href=\"http://viva.vporoom.com/trial-results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">viva.vporoom.com</a>:</p>\n<p><strong>DANCE Trial: Two-year Outcomes from the 157-Limb Atherectomy Cohort    <br /></strong>Presented by George Adams, M.D.<br />DANCE enrolled 262 subjects, with 157 limbs revascularized using atherectomy and 124 limbs receiving angioplasty. The preliminary 2-year primary patency rate is 72.8% and freedom from CD-TLR was seen in 85.2% of subjects. There was no loss of patency seen between months 24 and 25 as the analysis window was closed. Two-year results from the DANCE trial ATX group provide the largest, long-term data set of patency rates in atherectomy subjects with adjunctive local drug therapy. </p>\n<p><strong>Twenty-Four-Month Results of AcoArt I DCB Catheter: Randomized, Multicenter, Controlled Clinical Study in Femoropopliteal Arteries       <br /></strong>Presented by Wei Guo, M.D.<br />Two hundred Chinese patients with peripheral artery occlusive disease were prospectively randomized to treatment with the Orchid drug-coated balloon (DCB) or an uncoated balloon catheter. The primary endpoint was angiographic late lumen loss at 6 months, which was 0.05 ± 0.73 mm for the DCB group and 1.15 ± 0.89 mm for the uncoated balloon group. After 24 months, the freedom from CD-TLR rate was 86.5% vs 58.6% (<em>P</em> &lt; .05). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of death and major amputation (9.4% vs. 9.6%, <em>P</em> = .98). AcoArt I demonstrates safety and efficacy of Orchid DCB in treating femoropopliteal artery disease. </p>\n<p><strong>Safety and Efficacy of a Novel Percutaneous Bypass Procedure for Long-Segment Femoropopliteal Lesions &gt; 25 cm: A Sub-Analysis From the PQ Bypass DETOUR I Trial <br /></strong>Presented by Sean Lyden, M.D.<br />This prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized, single-arm trial is one of the largest prospective series to evaluate the percutaneous treatment of femoropopliteal blockages with lengths of 25 cm to 45 cm. The primary patency rate was 88.9% at 6 months with optimal device placement, and an overall primary patency rate of 76.9%. Delivery of devices and removal of the delivery system was successful in 100% of lesions. Improvement in Rutherford class of at least two grades was observed in 92% of patients; 94% of subjects improved ≥ one class over baseline at 6 months.</p>\n<p><strong>Clinical Outcomes Among Vascular Procedure Patients Receiving Suture-Mediated vs Surgical Cutdown for Closure of Large-Bore Arterial Access      <br /></strong>Presented by Darren Schneider, M.D.<br />This retrospective study utilized the IBM Explorys research database, which contains longitudinal patient data for approximately 55 million U.S. patients since 2012. Clinical outcomes and complication rates were compared among patients undergoing closure of large-bore arterial access using the Perclose ProGlide suture-mediated closure system (Abbott Vascular) versus surgical cutdown. A multivariate analysis showed significantly lower complication rates for Perclose patients. During the hospital admission for the procedure, Perclose patients were 80% less likely to require a blood transfusion and 41% less likely to have an infection. In addition, the mortality rate at 30 days was 70% lower among these patients. The average hospital length of stay during the index procedure was significantly shorter for Perclose patients (5.1 days vs 9 days; <em>P </em>&lt; .001). </p>\n<p><strong>Interim 18-Month Results of the AV Trial: A Randomized Trial of DCB\'s in Hemodialysis Arteriovenous Fistulae  <br /></strong>Presented by Scott Trerotola, M.D.<br />This randomized trial enrolled 285 patients with dysfunctional AVF. After successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, lesions were treated with either a Lutonix DCB (Bard Peripheral Vascular) or a control uncoated balloon. The primary safety endpoint was met and did not differ between groups. The 6-month efficacy endpoint was not met with target lesion primary patency (TLPP) of 71% for DCB and 63% for control; however, at the end of the 6-month window, TLPP was superior for DCB (64% vs 53%, <em>P </em>= .024). Interventions to maintain target lesion patency were fewer for DCB at 6 months (44/patient vs 64/patient; 31.3% fewer reinterventions). At interim 18 months, the survival curves remain separated with a 37% improvement in TLPP over control. </p>\n<p><strong>About VIVA Physicians<br /></strong>VIVA Physicians strive to be the premier educators in the field of vascular medicine and intervention.

Full data summaries can be found at <a href=\"http://viva.vporoom.com/trial-results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">viva.vporoom.com/trial-results</a>:</p>\n<p><strong>A Unique Bioconvertible Inferior Vena Cava Filter: 1-Year Results from the SENTRY Trial<br /></strong>Presented by Michael Dake, M.D.<br />In the SENTRY trial, 129 patients requiring temporary PE protection were enrolled across 23 sites. The rate of new symptomatic PE through 12 months was 0 percent (0/129). There were no instances of filter tilting, migration, embolization, fracture, IVC perforation through 12 months or device-related deaths. The rate of successful Sentry bioconversion was 95.7 percent at six months and 96.4 percent at 12 months, an improvement over published retrieval rates.</p>\n<p><strong>Two-Year Results from the IN.PACT Global Study<br /></strong>Presented by Thomas Zeller, M.D.<br />IN.PACT Global is a multicenter, international, prospective, single-arm study designed to expand on clinical evidence with the In.Pact Admiral drug-coated balloon (DCB) (Medtronic) for the treatment of real-world patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal disease. To date, IN.PACT Global is the largest independently adjudicated DCB study of real-world patients with femoropopliteal artery disease. Two-year results demonstrate consistent and durable clinical performance, and confirm the positive results observed in the IN.PACT SFA randomized trial. </p>\n<p><strong>Insights from the Zilver PTX Study in Japan<br /></strong>Presented by Michael Dake, M.D.<br />The first 900 patients in Japan treated with drug-eluting stents were enrolled in the Zilver PTX study. Nine hundred and five patients with 1,080 lesions were enrolled at 95 institutions. Comorbidities included a high incidence of chronic kidney disease (44 percent) and critical limb ischemia (21 percent). The current study continues to show positive outcomes through four years. For the challenging subgroups evaluated, results were similar and favorable through two years, indicating that the Zilver PTX DES may be a valid treatment option for patients with these difficult-to-treat lesions. </p>\n<p><strong>Primary Patency of the BioMimics 3D Helical Stent: Significant Outcome from the Mimics Study<br /></strong>Presented by Thomas Zeller, M.D.<br />The BioMimics 3D helical stent (Veryan Medical, Ltd.) has a 3D helical centerline designed to impart nonplanar curvature to the vessel, promoting swirling blood flow. The study randomized 76 patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease 2:1 to either BioMimics 3D or LifeStent (Bard Peripheral Vascular). A statistically significant difference was observed in primary patency through 24 months. These data support the BioMimics 3D helical stent in primary stenting of complex lesions and point to potential for complementary use with DCBs.</p>\n<p><strong>Four-Year Results of the IN.PACT SFA Trial: Drug-Coated Balloon Catheter vs. an Uncoated Balloon Catheter in Femoropopliteal Lesions<br /></strong>Presented by Peter Schneider, M.D.<br />IN.PACT SFA enrolled 331 patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal lesions.  Four-year results of the IN.PACT SFA trial demonstrated sustained treatment effect in maintaining significantly higher freedom from CD-TLR by KM estimate in patients treated with the In.Pact Admiral DCB compared to PTA despite a late catch-up effect. Among patients requiring reintervention, the mean time to the first event was significantly longer in the DCB group.</p>\n<p><strong>About VIVA Physicians<br /></strong><em>VIVA Physicians, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to advancing the field of vascular medicine and intervention through education and research, strives to be the premier educator in the field.

TLR rates were 20% in the angioplasty alone arm (7).  Finally, recent drug coated balloon data has also supported highly acceptable patency rates; initial experience with infrapopliteal paclitaxel coated balloon angioplasty for long tibial lesions found 3-month restenosis in one-quarter of patients, complete wound healing in three of four, and limb salvage in more than 95% (8).</p>\n<p>What do comparative studies inform us regarding the relative merits of surgery or endovascular therapy?   In a retrospective analysis, Zhan et al found equivalent improvements in limb perfusion as measured by toe pressures at a mean follow-up of 13- (surgical group) to 15- (endovascular group) months.  Major amputation was 11% in both treatment cohorts (9).  A propensity-score analysis of 1023 CLI patients compared 208 matched pairs of patients with follow-up out to five years following surgery or below-knee angioplasty.  Equal benefits were reported in both groups for repeat revascularization (21% surgery, 18% endo), subsequent bypass (5% vs. 12%), and major amputation (19% vs 17%) (10). This data and changing patient demographics since the BASIL trial have resulted in endovascular therapy being adopted as a first-line strategy in traditional surgical groups.  One recent study reported endovascular therapy as the initial treatment in 70% of patients referred for surgical evaluation (11).  An evaluation of 295 endovascularly-treated and 138 bypass patients (1/2 with autologous vein grafts) found no differences in primary-, assisted-, or secondary patency, amputation-free survival or limb salvage.  However, procedural mortality in the surgical group was more than double (6.0 vs 2.8%) (11).</p>\n<p>The currently enrolling Best Endovascular Strategy (BEST-CLI) trial, sponsored by the National Institute of Health, will provide additional and important data regarding long-term measurable outcomes in CLI patients randomized by treatment allocation.  Results are not expected for at least five years.  However, as with all large prospective randomized-controlled trials, a critical review will be necessary to determine the generalizability of the BEST-CLI results due to the large potential for randomization bias.  For now, there is strong support for endovascular therapy first in CLI patients.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ol><li>Adam DJ, Beard JD, Cleveland T, Bell J, Bradbury AW, Forbes JF, Fowkes FG, Gillepsie I, Ruckley CV, Raab G, Storkey H; BASIL trial participants. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16325694\">Bypass versus angioplasty in severe ischaemia of the leg (BASIL): multicentre, randomised controlled trial.</a> 2005 Dec 3; 366(9501):1925-34.</li><li>Rocha-Singh KJ, Jaff M, Joye J, Laird J, Ansel G, Schneider P; VIVA Physicians. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22605682\">Major adverse limb events and wound healing following infrapopliteal artery stent implantation in patients with critical limb ischemia: the XCELL trial.</a> Catheter Cardiovasc Interv. 2012 Nov 15;80(6):1042-51</li></ol>\n<ol><li>Rastan A, Tepe G, Krankenberg H, Zahorsky R, Beschorner U, Noory E, Sixt S, Schwarz T, Brechtel K, Böhme C, Neumann FJ, Zeller T. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21622669\">Sirolimus-eluting stents vs. bare-metal stents for treatment of focal lesions in infrapopliteal arteries: a double-blind, multi-centre, randomized clinical trial.</a> Eur Heart J. 2011 Sep;32(18):2274-81</li><li>Scheinert D, Katsanos K, Zeller T, Koppensteiner R, Commeau P, Bosiers M, Krankenberg H, Baumgartner I, Siablis D, Lammer J, Van Ransbeeck M, Qureshi AC, Stoll HP; ACHILLES Investigators. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23194941\">A prospective randomized multicenter comparison of balloon angioplasty and infrapopliteal stenting with the sirolimus-eluting stent in patients with ischemic peripheral arterial disease: 1-year results from the ACHILLES trial.</a> J Am Coll Cardiol. 2012 Dec 4; 60(22):2290-5.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=McMillan%20WD%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=20961774\">McMillan WD</a>1, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Leville%20CD%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=20961774\">Leville CD</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Long%20TD%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=20961774\">Long TD</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Gomes%20M%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=20961774\">Gomes M</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Groffsky%20JL%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=20961774\">Groffsky JL</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Schultz%20SR%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=20961774\">Schultz SR</a>.

EINSTEIN, RE-COVER, AMPLIFY and the Hokusai-VTE trials have found Rivaroxaban, Dabigitran, Apixaban and Edoxaban each to be non-inferior to standard therapy in the treatment of VTE. With the rise of these new agents one may ask: <strong><em>What is the relevance of warfarin in the treatment of VTE in the modern era?</em></strong></p>\n<h2>Advantages of novel oral anticoagulants</h2>\n<p>NOACs have several advantages when compared to warfarin:</p>\n<ol><li>Predictable pharmacokinetics which allow for fixed dosing without monitoring.</li><li>Lower potential for food and drug interactions</li><li>Rivaroxaban and Apixaban do not require initial overlap (“bridging”) therapy with heparin or enoxaparin.</li></ol>\n<p>Thus, for many newly diagnosed VTE patients no injection therapy, blood monitoring or any form of hospitalization may be necessary for their VTE diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>Disadvantages of novel oral anticoagulants</h2>\n<p>With the obvious benefits of the NOACs who should they be avoided in?</p>\n<ol><li>First, NOACs should be avoided in those patients that the trials did not include in enrollment. These include patients who may need anticoagulation but also have antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, heparin induced thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis, creatinine clearanceHokusai-VTE study. Thus, only Edoxaban may be considered in patients with submassive pulmonary embolism.Without evidence from randomized control trials that NOACs are non inferior to warfarin in these patient populations, warfarin therapy remains standard of care.</li><li>Cancer patients mandate specific attention. The trials which have compared NOACs to warfarin included only a small number of cancer patients. Furthermore, there have been to date no trials comparing new oral anticoagulants with low molecular weight heparin in patients with active cancer. Thus enoxaparin remains the standard for cancer related VTE events.</li><li>Novel oral anticoagulants should also likely be avoided in gastric bypass patients. Without a predictable way of monitoring NOACs, there is no clear way of assessing absorption in this patient population and importantly these patients were not specifically studied.</li><li>Another group to avoid with NOAC therapy are patients who exhibit poor compliance with warfarin monitoring. In these patients inability to monitor NOACs may be a problem as providers will no be clearly able to assess therapeutic levels.</li><li>Finally, patients whose creatinine level may change over time should not be offered NOACs as all are effected by renal clearance.</li></ol>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Though NOACs clearly have a place in current management of VTE, long-term data on these agents is still lacking.

 ('183', '233', 'en_us', 'Sole Pedal Access as primary approach in invasive management of PAD', '<p>Peripheral arterial disease is a prevalent disease affecting 8 million Americans and is associated with significant morbidity like intermittent claudication, critical limb ischemia and limb loss. Interventions for peripheral arterial disease have recently moved towards more endovascular procedures compared to traditional surgery. Primary approach for such endovascular procedures remains common femoral artery either contra-lateral or ipsi-lateral. Although commonly used, access via the common femoral artery (CFA) is associated with significant risk of access site bleeding, hematoma, retro-peritoneal bleeding, psuedoaneurysm and A-V fistula. Also, the more commonly used contra-lateral CFA approach has technical challenges especially with tortuousity/occlusion of the iliac arteries. </p>\n<p>Pedal artery access has been described previously by many operators as an alternative to groin access. Currently, this approach is usually reserved as secondary option after failed antegrade approach or as an adjunct for complex lesions in patients with critical limb ischemia. This can be attributed to many factors including risk of occlusion of artery accessed (specially in cases of single-vessel run off), lack of dedicated instruments, spasm and effective hemostasis methods.</p>\n<p>Here we describe our new technique and experience with first 80 patients who underwent invasive management of PAD via sole pedal access as the primary approach. </p>\n<h2>Method for pedal access</h2>\n<h3>Access</h3>\n<p>Under ultrasound guidance using a 21 gauge needle DP, PT or peroneal artery was accessed either by counter-puncture or direct puncture method (Fig 1).<br />\n<a href=\"http://viva365.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Fig-1.png\" class=\"image-popup\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-357\" alt=\"Sooraj Pedal Access Fig 1\" src=\"http://viva365.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Fig-1-300x277.png\" style=\"background-attachment:scroll;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);background-image:none;background-repeat:repeat;border-bottom-color:rgb(226,226,226);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(226,226,226);border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1px;border-right-color:rgb(226,226,226);border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1px;border-top-color:rgb(226,226,226);border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1px;clear:both;color:rgb(210,41,29);font-size:16px;height:277px;margin-bottom:20px;margin-left:108.38px;margin-right:108.38px;margin-top:10px;max-width:504.22px;padding-bottom:6px;padding-left:6px;padding-right:6px;padding-top:6px;vertical-align:baseline;\" width=\"300\" height=\"277\" /></a><br />\nMicropuncture wire is advanced under fluoroscopic guidance and if needed contrast angiography is performed to visualize the vessel anatomy.

Once bleeding is noticed at the access site, an additional 1-2 cc of air is used to inflate the balloon so that the bleeding stops. This allows having sufficient pressure to achieve hemostasis without occluding the blood flow through the artery. The band is kept in place for 30 minutes and then slowly decompressed over 5-10 minutes and removed if no bleeding is observed. Patients are allowed to mobilize at this time. Access site patency is checked.</p>\n<h3>Follow up</h3>\n<p>Our practice is to evaluate the access site with clinical examination by the physician at 1 week and with duplex ultrasound at 1 month.</p>\n<h2>Our Experience</h2>\n<p>We recently presented our data of consecutive 80 patients approached via this novel technique. Access was successfully obtained in 74 (92%). A total of 8 (10%) patients required femoral access for various reasons including failure to obtain pedal access, spasm or need for additional support. Out of 80 patients 51 patients required intervention of which 45 (88%) were performed via pedal access only. Most notably there were no complications in these patients. Access site evaluation at 1 month was available in 71 of 74 patients accessed as 3 patients were lost to follow up. All 71 patients had patent access site and no complications were observed. </p>\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\n<p>Primary pedal access may be a safe and feasible alternative to traditional femoral approach. Pedal access has several advantages.</p>\n<ol><li>Reduced rate of complications associated with femoral approach.</li><li>Reduced procedure time. (less tortuosity compared to contra-lateral femoral approach).</li><li>Reduced radiation exposure due to shorter procedure time and less scatter radiation from lower extremity compared to abdomen. </li><li>Shorter recovery time and early ambulation may increase patient comfort.</li></ol>\n<p>In published literature major retrospective case series have explored different methods of retrograde approach. Recently Mustapha et al described their technique in a case-series of 23 patients who were thought to be high risk of groin complications as primary approach. They had no access site complications similar to our study. Walker et al described the largest reported case series of 228 CLI patients with retrograde approach after failed antegrade approach. In this series there was one access site occlusion and two pseudo-aneurysms requiring covered stent placement (1.3% complication rate). Montero-Baker and colleagues had described 51 cases, including 6 claudicants, with pedal access after failed antegrade approach and reported 1 access site occlusion, two perforations and hematomas.</p>\n<p>Our technique is extrapolated from our extensive trans-radial experience as interventional cardiologist and learning curve might be longer for those who lack these skills. Also pedal access has limitations including significant lesions in below the knee arteries which may require treatment prior to approaching lesions above the knee. </p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In our limited single center experience primary pedal approach seems safe and feasible. In future further analysis with comparison to femoral approach will shed more light on superiority of this approach.  Our access site success, rate of complications and procedural success is in line with previously reported case series utilizing retrograde approach.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ol><li>Allison MA, Ho E, Denenberg JO, Langer RD, Newman AB, Fabsitz RR, Criqui MH.

 ('186', '236', 'en_us', 'What is the best treatment for this acute limb ischemia patient?', '<p>This issue is complex but approached in a systematic way most patients declare themselves better suited to one form of revascularisation therapy over another (the options being Chemical Versus Mechanical Lysis Versus Surgical Thrombectomy). The decision making and treatment algorithm starts with a thorough history and physical examination. Initially focused on confirming that acute limb ischaemia (ALI) is indeed the culprit pathology, intravenous heparin is commenced to counter the risk of thrombus propagation. </p>\n<h2>Assessing acute limb ischemia</h2>\n<p>The physician must be cognizant of the many pathologies that may cause ALI but equally that in the clear majority the cause will result from in situ thrombosis of the native vessel, embolism (usually cardiogenic) or thrombosis of a lower limb bypass graft. Clues may include history of AF/recent AMI, claudication, PAD/previous bypass surgery. The circulatory examination will include all pulses upper and lower limb and their nature, the precordium, abdomen, global neurological function and most importantly lower limbs. Examine the contralateral lower limb for evidence of intact pulses and emboli then focus on the affected limb, once again examining for pulses, color, temperature, old scars, neurological function (motor and sensory), compartmental tension/pain and Doppler signals both arterial and venous. This process allows the physician to determine the Rutherford category of ALI (I, Viable; IIa, Threatened/Marginal; IIb ,Threatened/Immediate; III, Major tissue/Nerve damage Inevitable) which in turn determines the best approach to treatment.</p>\n<h2>Choosing the right treatment for acute limb ischemia</h2>\n<p>Stage I can be treated electively after imaging, much as with IC/CLI. Stage III is likely to require amputation or in some cases palliation, unless presentation is very early. Stage IIa can be imaged with angiography/CTA prior to determine the best strategy, whereas IIb requires immediate revascularisation to avoid permanent nerve damage and/or extensive tissue loss. Catheter directed thrombolysis (CDT) has the advantage of being less invasive, as well as facilitating convenient angiographic imaging and supplemental endovascular therapy if required. It is therefore preferred when there is adequate time, the patient is frail or run-off is thrombosed and there are no contraindications to thrombolysis. Surgical thrombo-embolectomy is preferred when timely revascularisation is needed, proximal vessels/bypass grafts are involved with preservation of run-off or the duration of ischemia goes beyond 14 days. There are an array of pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy methods that offer a timely and less invasive solution for revascularisation. Their advantage over CDT is related to shorter procedural times, non-reliance on ICU and potentially lower rates of bleeding.</p>\n<h2>Some final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Finally, one must have a low threshold for performing compartmental fasciotomy following revascularistion. We must identify a source of embolus if that is suspected and provide an anti-coagulation solution both immediately and into the future to prevent recurrent limb threatening events. </p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2018-02-22 19:45:55', '2018-02-22 19:45:55', '6e710aff-f4b3-4773-933a-648c1b87c0a0'),

 ('189', '239', 'en_us', 'What Happens to Patients Who Suffer Pulmonary Embolus', '<p>Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and often fatal disease process whose clinical presentation and long term outcome is widely variable. The natural evolution of PE ranges significantly, with abrupt hemodynamic compromise and death within one hour for approximately 10% of all cases. In contrast, approximately one third of patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) present with asymptomatic PE . The pathophysiologic consequences of an acute PE are primarily hemodynamic and manifest when approximately 30-50% of the pulmonary bed is obstructed. When this obstruction approaches 75%, the right ventricle (RV) must acutely generate a systolic pressure above 50 mm Hg, which a normal ventricle cannot accommodate. This leads to RV ischemia and dysfunction, and in severe cases, septal shift resulting in left ventricular obstruction and significant hypotension . Early mortality  is closely linked to the probability of recurrent PE with an associated death rate of approximately 25%.  This cascade of events can progress rapidly, and if unrecognized and untreated, PE mortality approaches approximately 30%. </p>\n<p>	Although certain clinical signs and symptoms can help to guide the clinician towards the diagnosis of PE, these are often nonspecific and lack adequate positive or negative predictive value for conclusive diagnosis. Therefore, several objective measures should be employed to help risk stratify patients into massive (high), submassive (intermediate) and nonmassive (low) PE categories . A patient meets criteria for massive PE when they present with systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg (or a systolic pressure decrease greater than 40 mm Hg from baseline) for greater than 15 minutes. Additional  criteria for massive PE include persistent hypotension requiring pressor support, pulselessness or persistent bradycardia (less than 40 bpm). Submassive PE criteria include evidence of RV dysfunction, RV chamber dilation (either by echocardiogram or computed tomography), EKG changes or elevated biomarkers (troponin I or T, or brain naturietic peptide).  Nonmassive PE do not meet criteria for either massive or submassive PE. </p>\n<p>	 Early risk stratification for patients with PE is essential as mortality dramatically increases with escalating level of risk. Early mortality exceeds 15% for patients who meet criteria for massive PE. Within this subgroup, mortality approaches 70% for those who require cardiopulmonary resuscitation vs approximately 25% for patients who present with shock .  Even within the submassive PE subcategory, RV dysfunction alone is associated with a 3 to 15% early mortality risk.  An RV diameter/LV diameter ratio greater than 0.9 on chest CT is associated with an 82% thirty day adverse event rate (odds ratio 4.0) . This also portends to long term consequences as dysfunction that does not resolve at hospital discharge is associated with 13% risk of PE-related mortality at three years . In contrast there is a 4% three year mortality for patients with resolved RV dysfunction at hospital discharge. Other findings on echocardiogram can also indicate poor prognosis, including severe RV free wall hypokinesis with sparing of the apex (McConnell’s sign), pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid regurgitation, and RV thrombus. Cardiac biomarkers also assist with short term prognostication where the odds ratio for short term mortality is 5.9 for patients with elevated troponin , and is 9.5 and 5.7 for patients who present with elevated BNP or pro-BNP , respectively.  Non massive PE carry significant less mortality burden, with &lt;1% of patients experiencing early death. \nThe long term all-cause mortality of acute PE is significantly linked to concurrent clinical parameters which include advanced age, malignancy, neurodegenerative disease, chronic renal disease and cardiovascular disease . Approximately one-third of all patients who suffer a PE will die within 5 years and the predominant cause of long term mortality is associated cardiovascular disease. Finally, it is important to consider longstanding pulmonary hypertension due to chronic thromboembolic disease, affecting approximately 0.5-3% of all patients who experience PE . \n</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol><li>Stein P, Matta F, Musani M, Diaczok B.

 ('191', '241', 'en_us', 'Fenestrated and Branched Stent Grafts are Best for Arch Aneurysms', '<p>Aortic arch aneurysms present a significant clinical challenge. Despite improvements in operative techniques and peri-operative care, open repair of aortic arch aneurysms is still plagued by significant morbidity and mortality. Endovascular approaches have significantly altered our approach to aortic arch disease, with the hopes of diminishing complications and mortality. When considering endovascular repair, however, there are many notable obstacles that must be overcome in order to achieve successful exclusion of the aneurysm. Some of these mandates are not unique to endovascular repair of the arch, such as the need for adequate length and diameter of the proximal and distal seal zones. Some obstacles, however, are unique to the arch and include the potential difficulty of navigating through tight arches, maneuvering near the aortic valve, preventing stroke, and maintaining perfusion of the great vessels. Initial approaches to endovascular repair have relied upon extra-anatomic debranching of the arch, with inflow to the great vessels transitioned to a site away from the intended seal zones. These debranching techniques have included bypasses using the ascending aorta as an inflow source, or other extra-anatomic locations such as the carotid arteries. </p>\n<p>Initial approaches to “pure” endovascular repair of the aortic arch involved the incorporation of a solitary branch – designed initially for the subclavian artery. These involved the placement of a fenestration (reinforced hole), or an actual branch, incorporated into a thoracic endograft. The fenestration or branch would be aligned with the subclavian artery and secured in place with a bridging stent. One of the original series for this approach was reported by Inoue et al. in 1999 (1). They described the placement of a branched aortic endograft within the aortic arch in 15 patients. Fourteen patients had a solitary branch, while 1 had two branches. Their initial technical success (complete exclusion of the aneurysm) was 60%, with 2 patients have access issues and 4 patients having an initial endoleak. In a mean follow up of 12 months, 73% of patients had complete exclusion of their arch aneurysm. Similar approaches have recently been employed by both Medtronic () and Gore () who have launched clinical trials to assess the outcomes of a single branched aortic arch branched endograft. </p>\n<p>The incorporation of one branch, however, does not allow for the total endovascular repair of aortic arch pathologies without at least some hybrid approach to preserve flow to the left carotid and subclavian artery systems. To overcome this, and with the evolution of endovascular device designs, several different devices have been described for the complete repair of the aortic arch with fenestrated and branched endografts. One approach has been to apply in situ fenestrations to standard thoracic aortic endografts. This can be accomplished with the use of a retrograde puncture of the endograft with the use of either a stiff wire system or a laser. The fenestration is then reinforced with the placement of a bridging stent. Arch-specific grafts have also been described. The largest series comes from the mid-term results of Next-gen Fenestrated TEVAR trial in Japan (2). The trial employs a customized, precurved, fenestrated endograft (Najuta Stent-graft, Kawasumi Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan), which is comprised of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membrane supported by self-expanding Z-stents. The device has 19 types of curved stent skeleton designs and 8 types of graft fenestrations. The system was used in 393 patients with aortic arch aneurysms at 35 medical centers between 2010 and 2011. Technical success (ability to deliver and deploy the graft) was achieved in 99% of patients, with an initial success without type 1 or 3 endoleaks was achieved in 95% of patients. Thirty-day mortality was only 1.5% and only 1.7% of patients had a neurologic event. Critics of the study, however, that durability of this system has yet to be demonstrated. </p>\n<p>The use of a true branched endograft has been described by Haulon et al (3). They describe the outcomes of 38 patients (from 10 centers) that underwent complete arch replacement with a branched aortic endograft. The majority of the grafts had two branches that would allow for the incorporation of the innominate artery and the left carotid artery. Technical success (placement of the endograft with incorporation of the branches and no type 1 or 3 endoleak) was achieved in 84% of the patients. In this high-risk group, 30-day mortality was 13.5% with a similar 13.5% rate of neurologic events. Twenty-nine percent of the patients had evidence of an endoleak on pre-discharge imaging, with 5 proximal type 1 endoleaks, 3 type 2 endoleaks, 1 type 3 endoleak, and 2 of unknown etiology. Two of the endoleaks required an early intervention, and by 6 months of follow up the two indeterminate endoleaks and one of the type 1 endoleaks spontaneously resolved. At a median follow up of 12 months, 9% of the patients required a secondary intervention. In addition, there as a 12% late mortality, none were aortic arch related. The authors were able to demonstrate a significant learning curve with this technology. When compared with the first 10 global cases, the remainder of the cohort had significantly lower intraoperative complications, operative time, fluoroscopy time, endoleak rates and secondary procedure rates. </p>\n<p>The evolution of endovascular therapy is significantly changing our approaches to treating aortic disease. This progress is clearly seen even in the complex setting of aortic arch pathology. With improvement of device design, and a growing global experience, improved technical performance and immediate clinical outcomes will continue to improve. Clearly, however, we will need larger volume analysis over a significant period of time to better assess the durability of these devices in the setting of the aortic arch. </p>\n<h3>References:</h3>\n<ol><li>\nInoue K, Hosokawa H, Iwase T, Sato M, Yoshida Y, Ueno K, et al.

 ('193', '243', 'en_us', 'Pulmonary Embolism Response Team', '<h2>The problem: There is much uncertainty in the management of pulmonary embolism</h2>\n<p>Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) presents diagnostic and management challenges to the contemporary vascular medicine specialist:  PE remains a great masquerader given its protean, non-specific manifestations, and, in terms of management, guidelines describe use of only a few of the available therapeutic interventions besides anticoagulation.  The need for data-driven therapeutic strategies is evident, but unlike other areas of vascular medicine and interventional cardiology, few randomized trials exist and future robust trials may be difficult to design and conduct.  Compounding this difficulty is the urgency with which some severe, e.g. “massive”,  PE patients require implementation of definitive therapy.  On the other hand, while initially normotensive PE patients have lower mortality, they may exhibit latent RV dysfunction which may manifest downstream as debilitating pulmonary hypertension;  thus the vascular medicine specialist must make a risk-benefit calculation that includes less well quantifiable parameters such as exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life.</p>\n<h2>The concept of a pulmonary embolism response team</h2>\n<p>In assessing the practices of modern PE therapy, comparisons may be drawn to both urgent medical response systems as well as multidisciplinary heart teams.  With regard to the former, rapid response teams have generally been implemented nationwide as a means to quickly mobilize expertise and resources for deteriorating patients.  Examples of this analogy are the protocolized responses for ST segment elevation MI and stroke.  Cardiovascular practitioners are also familiar with multidisciplinary teams for transcatheter aortic valve replacement, which amalgates the experience of cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, interventionalists, echocardiographers and radiologists, and anesthesiologists.  Out of these analogies, and as a response to assessing and reducing variation in care of PE patients, the PERT – Pulmonary Embolism Response Team – was born and launched October 2012 at <a href=\"http://www.massgeneral.org/\">Massachusetts General Hospital</a> (MGH).  </p>\n<h2>Pulmonary embolism response team: Operational concepts</h2>\n<p>The aim of PERT is to provide an expeditious and coordinated analysis and management opinion on complicated PE cases derived from a multidisciplinary consult so as to optimally use all available therapeutic interventions.  The Massachusetts General Hospital PERT is activated with a single page by a referring clinician, whereupon a vascular medicine fellow evaluates the patient with history, exam, and review of available data including electrocardiogram, CT scan, ultrasonography, and laboratory tests.  Based on PE severity and management questions, a virtual case conference with discussion of clinical data and imaging is convened via <a href=\"http://www.gotomeeting.com/online/\">commercial meeting software</a>, with participation by PERT-affiliated vascular medicine and intervention specialists, cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, echocardiographers, radiologists, and hematologists.  The referring physician is included in the online conference, so that recommendations can be immediately conveyed and implemented, especially as regards systemic thrombolytics, catheter-directed thrombolytics and pharmacomechanical strategies, and surgical and mechanical circulatory support options.  In 2 years of existence, MGH PERT fielded 300 consultations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://viva365.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PERT-MGH-poster.jpg\" class=\"image-popup\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-287\" alt=\"PERT MGH poster\" src=\"http://viva365.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PERT-MGH-poster-194x300.jpg\" style=\"background-attachment:scroll;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);background-image:none;background-repeat:repeat;border-bottom-color:rgb(226,226,226);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(226,226,226);border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1px;border-right-color:rgb(226,226,226);border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1px;border-top-color:rgb(226,226,226);border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1px;clear:both;color:rgb(210,41,29);font-size:16px;height:300px;margin-bottom:20px;margin-left:161.38px;margin-right:161.38px;margin-top:10px;max-width:504.22px;padding-bottom:6px;padding-left:6px;padding-right:6px;padding-top:6px;vertical-align:baseline;\" width=\"194\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Pulmonary embolism response team: Research and educational opportunities</h2>\n<p>At a system level, PERT aims to collect data and study the therapeutic outcome based on the presenting PE phenotype, as a means to advance the science of PE diagnostics and management.

 ('195', '245', 'en_us', 'Approach to Patients with Acute Limb Ischemia', '<p>The assessment and management of acute limb ischemia begins with a thorough history and physical exam.  The most important aspects include timing of symptom onset and the “5 Ps” (pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesias, and paralysis).  Once the diagnosis has been suspected, Doppler ultrasound should be performed, and intravenous heparin-based anticoagulation initiated as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2>Categories of acute limb ischemia</h2>\n<p>Based on physical exam (presence or absence of sensory loss and muscle weakness) and arterial and venous Doppler findings, staging is performed:</p>\n<ul><li>Class I – Patients without weakness or sensory loss, and with flow detected on both arterial and venous Doppler. These indicate a viable limb which is not immediately threatened.</li><li>Class IIa (marginally threatened limb) patients will have mild sensory loss and mild-moderately decreased arterial Doppler findings (see figures 1 and 2).</li><li>Class IIb – Significant sensory loss with mild-moderate muscle weakness and decreased/absent arterial Doppler. This stage indicates an immediately threatened limb.</li><li>Class III – The absence of venous flow is ominous finding, identifying a Class III limb (irreversible damage); profound sensory loss and muscle weakness will be noted at this stage.</li></ul>\n<h2>Treatment of acute limb ischemia</h2>\n<p>Treatment of acute limb ischemia should be driven by clinical acuity. Furthermore, classes I and IIa may be treated successfully with percutaneous revascularization therapy. Here are a few guiding points:</p>\n<ul><li>Class I patients may treated electively, although for some patients earlier angiography may be appropriate.\n</li><li>Class I and IIa – Once angiography is performed, the findings will direct whether catheter directed thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy is the better course of action.  If catheter based thrombolysis is performed, follow-up angiography can then demonstrate the presence and extent of any underlying lesion.  The patient may then be treated with anticoagulation, percutaneous intervention, or surgical bypass.</li><li>Class IIb patients usually will require surgical embolectomy due to the time-sensitive nature of their condition.   After embolectomy, as in IIa patients, angiography will determine the pathway depending on the results.</li><li>Amputation is frequently required for patients presenting with Class III findings, depending on the duration of the symptoms.   For those patients presenting relatively early, surgical embolectomy may be attempted, while a late presentation will likely necessitate an amputation.  Fasciotomy should also be considered early in these patients course.</li></ul>\n<p>When an initial percutaneous approach is undertaken, the etiology of the occlusion will often determine the optimal strategy for managing the patient:</p>\n<ul><li>In cases of arterial or bypass graft thrombosis, there is frequently an underlying atherosclerotic obstruction which will require intervention in addition to a thrombectomy.</li><li>Acute thrombus responds well to mechanical thrombectomy and thrombolysis.   Sub-acute thrombus does not typically respond as well to mechanical thrombectomy and thrombolysis alone, and sometimes the addition of laser atherectomy can lead to improved results.</li><li>Patients with distal embolism can be successfully managed with thrombolysis or embolectomy.</li><li>Finally, limb ischemia from trauma is best managed with embolectomy and surgery.</li></ul>\n<p>A thorough but rapid assessment of the patient and a team-based systematic approach will lead to optimal outcomes for patients presenting with acute limb ischemia.</p>\n<p>References:    Rutherford RB.

 ('197', '247', 'en_us', 'Common Femoral Artery: Mine? Yours? Oops!', '<p>Over the course of the past two decades, advances in endovascular interventions have dramatically changed the way we treat vascular disease.  Targets that once were sacred to the gold standard of open surgery have been converted to a minimally invasive approach, where the impact on the patient is lessened and the quality of the outcomes preserved.  Many of us, vascular surgeons included, now employ an “endo first” approach to peripheral arterial disease, and reserve surgery as a provisional option for prohibitive anatomy and recurrent disease.  That being said, the common femoral artery (CFA) remains a controversial territory, and many still view it as the sole domain of the vascular surgeon.</p>\n<p>Historically, common femoral endarterectomy (CFE) has been associated with excellent outcomes.  Surgical series cite a high rate of technical success, good long-term patency, and reasonable return to function for the patient.  It is hard to argue that any therapy other than CFE is appropriate in the “right patient”.  Of course the right patient is in the eye of the beholder.  We all recognize that what a patient is offered is very often related to who they present to for an opinion.  Our challenge, regardless of our discipline-orientation, is to truly offer the patient the best option.  </p>\n<p>Current practice has introduced a number of devices that allow for endovascular treatment of CFA disease.  Simple angioplasty with provisional stenting has been reported to have good technical success, reasonable patency, and minimal complications.  Data with more advanced devices and multi-device therapy is lacking, but in individual cases one can achieve sustainable results.  Anti-proliferative balloon therapies (cryoplasty, drug coated balloons) may limit restenosis; atherectomy devices may allow for important debulking; and fracture-free, drug eluting stents or stent grafts may provide durable patency…time and trials will tell.</p>\n<p>As the portal of flow to the profunda, the true lifeblood of the leg, the CFA needs to be treated with equal attention before and after intervention as well.  VIVA Physicians have initiated an educational module promoting the routine use of ultrasound-guided micro-puncture access for all interventions.  This effort is intended to help endovascular specialists to establish quality initiatives in their home institutions.  The old standard of “palpate, poke, and pray” exposes each of our patients to unnecessary risks.  The ability to truly “see” the CFA with ultrasound, to determine the exact location of the profunda bifurcation, and to avoid plaque and calcification ultimately low for much safer access.  Such an approach also benefits our interventional exit strategy as it helps to guide and select methods of vessel closure.  </p>\n<p>Ideally, the approach to the common femoral artery should be an “ours” approach…it should be done collaboratively with multi-disciplinary input.  This is especially true when it comes to large-bore access.  Proper consultation between non-surgical interventionalists and cardiac and vascular surgical colleagues is essential for patient safety and outcomes.  Suture-based closure devices have enabled us to percutaneously perform EVAR’s, TEVAR’s, and TAVR’s with a high degree of success.  This approach, however, is far from perfect and failed percutaneous closure is not the time to figure out what your back-up plan is going to be.  Our institution recently instituted a large bore policy to insure that appropriate surgical backup is in place prior to starting any procedure involving a 14F sheath or larger.  Such an approach insures optimal patient safety and stands to further improve our interventional outcomes.</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2018-02-22 19:50:45', '2018-02-22 19:50:45', '645bc3e0-4c62-4fd9-90bb-5de0f52d3fff'),

 ('199', '249', 'en_us', 'Tibial and Pedal Runoff Salvage: Indications and Techniques', '<p>How Aggressive Should I Be in Salvaging Tibial and Pedal Runoff and What Are the Techniques?</p>\n<p>\nThe current approach to limb salvage is a moving target. Endovascular therapy is accepted as first line in the majority of cases yet the definitive answer to the most appropriate approach is 5 years away (<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02060630\">BEST trial</a>). Till then, aggressive endovascular approach is considered to be justified and procedural choice is currently largely dictated by the clinical presentation, extent of gangrene, diabetes, length of lesion, presence of calcification, need for dialysis, a patient’s functional status and compliance.</p>\n<p>\nWith the recent publication of the <a href=\"http://www.jvascsurg.org/article/S0741-5214(13)01515-2/pdf\">WiFi system that was adopted by the Society for Vascular Surgery</a>, vascular specialist can now be more objective about the chances of limb salvage and realistic about the appropriateness of primary amputation.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Standard antegrade endoluminal and subintimal approach is usually successful in &gt;90% of cases. However, the threshold for resorting to retrograde approach is lower than what it was just 3 years ago. The aim is to restore direct in-line flow for 1-2 tibial arteries for “below the knee” and “below the ankle” (BTK and BTA) revascularization. This is not to deny that open bypass with good quality vein is probably the best option for healing a foot wound yet the number of patients who are being offered and are good candidates for bypass is at all times low.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe alternative techniques for lower extremity revascularization is also a moving target. The inventory is at all times high and the skill of the specialists is equally developed. In order to adopt an aggressive approach to tibial runoff, key points need to be addressed. I believe the most important is patient selection and developing a sound plan for intervention and backup. Also, extensive inventory for crossing CTO, wires, support catheters, low profile balloons, drug-coated balloons and stents.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn summary, being aggressive in regards to salvage of the tibial runoff is dependent on the clinical scenario and should be individualized. The WiFi system is helpful and may find its way into the main stream just like the older TASC classification. While complex endovascular skills are required in most difficult cases, it is also advised to accept modest but clinically useful results.

 ('201', '251', 'en_us', 'What Did CORAL Tell Us, and What Didn’t CORAL Tell Us?', '<p>The consideration to intervene on patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) has been controversial ever since Blum’s publication of 74 ostial ARAS cases .  There have been a number of single center  and multicenter registries  designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of renal artery stent deployment for ARAS.  In a recent meta-analysis of 5 multicenter renal artery stent registries involving over 900 patients, renal artery stent deployment did result in a meaningful reduction in systolic blood pressure .  However, registries do not provide the highest level of evidence required to provide broad recommendations around indications for interventions.  In fact, multisocietal guidelines documents provide relatively little guidance on the indications for renal artery stent deployment in patients with ARAS.</p>\n<p>There have been many attempts at developing non-invasive (renal resistive index at the time of renal artery duplex ultrasonography , brain natriuretic peptide assays ) and invasive (translesional pressure gradients, intravascular ultrasound ,  and fractional flow reserve ) predictors of outcomes before the renal revascularization has been performed.  None of these have gained widespread utility.<br />\nWithin the past 6 years, three major randomized trials have been published, all suggesting that there is no advantage of stent vs optimal medical therapy in patients with ARAS.  These include the STAR  and ASTRAL  studies, both of which specifically evaluated patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ARAS.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1310753\">CORAL trial</a> was designed to study patients with hypertension or CKD and ARAS, with composite primary cardiovascular and renal endpoints .  In this challenging study with excellent trial oversight, 947 patients with hypertension on at least 2 anti-hypertensive medications or chronic kidney disease were randomized to optimal medical therapy or optimal medical therapy plus stent deployment.  With a primary endpoint evaluating cardiovascular and renal factors (mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, need for dialysis), there was no advantage to stent-based therapy.  Subset analysis did not identify a single group who benefitted from stent-based therapy, including those with global renal ischemia, recurrent “flash” pulmonary edema, or those with impaired renal function.</p>\n<p>So, is this the end of stenting for ARAS?  Well, if we had another decade and many more millions of dollars for clinical trials, I think not.  Clearly, there are patient subgroups who potentially benefit from this intervention, most notably those who truly fail a reasonable attempt at antihypertensive and lipid lowering therapy.  Those patients were not studied in CORAL.</p>\n<p>However, in this era of affordable care, I suspect that there is little appetite for another prospective multicenter randomized trial of the subsets of patients who really may benefit from this intervention….for example, those with very severe ARAS (quantitative angiographic evidence of &gt;80% aorto-ostial lesions) with physiologic evidence of hemodynamic significance (translesional pressure gradients, fractional flow reserve); African Americans with very severe hypertension (fewer than 10% of the entire CORAL cohort were representative of this patient population); and those patients recently committed to hemodialysis for ARAS.<br />\nWe may be facing severe limitations in reimbursement for patients with ARAS and hypertension, even if they were not sufficiently included in CORAL.  Let this be a lesson to physicians….we must be committed to clinical trials studying patients in whom data is lacking.  If we don’t, time and governmental oversight may answer the questions for us.</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol><li>Blum U, Krumme B, Flugel P, et al.

Just recently published and presented studies investigating drug coated balloons (DCB) have shown a substantial improvement of durability of endovascular treatment of femoro-popliteal vessels. </p>\n<p>First in human trials such as THUNDER, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456716\">LEVANT 1</a>, <a href=\"http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1383854\">BIOLUX 1</a>, and <a href=\"http://circinterventions.ahajournals.org/content/5/6/831.long\">PACIFIER</a> have shown significantly better technical outcomes in terms of late lumen loss and patency rate up to 2 years and in addition clinical benefit in terms of significantly reduced TLR rate up to 5 years (THUNDER) as compared to plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA). However, these studies were not sufficiently powered for relevant clinical endpoints and mostly included more simple lesions usually defined as TASC A and B lesions. </p>\n<p>Recently, two larger scale pivotal trials – <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23040582\">Inpact SFA</a> I &amp; II and <a href=\"http://www.cxvascular.com/vn-latest-news/vascular-news---latest-news/levant-2-one-year-results-presented-at-fda-panel-meeting\">Levant 2</a> – confirmed the superiority of DCB compared to POBA not only regarding technical outcomes at one year but also regarding harder clinical endpoints such as freedom from TLR, ABI, and quality of life. Again, these studies were limited to femoro-popliteal lesions in a length up to 15cm according TASC A and B lesions. Stent rates in these trials in the DEB cohorts were 7.3% (Inpact SFA) and 2.5% (Levant 2). Thus, it can be concluded that DCB angioplasty can be recommended for treatment of TASC A &amp; B lesions as first line strategy with a very low provisional stent rate.</p>\n<p>However data regarding the treatment of more complex TASC C &amp; D femoro-popliteal lesions with DCB is still sparse. Single center data from Bad Krozingen (mean lesion length 19cm, range 10 to 40cm) and Leipzig (mean lesion length 24cm) for the treatment of long lesions suggests a less pronounced relation of 1-year primary patency with lesion length as known for bare metal nitinol stents. In the Leipzig registry primary 1-year patency for all kind of femoro-popliteal lesions was 77.6%, for SFA only lesions 82.4%, and for instent restenotic lesions (ISR) 85.2% with a provisional stent rate of 23.3%. In the Bad Krozingen registry primary 1-year patency rate was 76.1% with a provisional stent rate of 18.3%. A recently presented interims analysis of the Inpact global registry including all comers with femoro-popliteal lesions including ISR with a mean lesion length of approximately 12cm clinically driven 1-year TLR rate was 8.7%.</p>\n<p>In summary, it is time for change of the paradigm of the treatment of femoro-popliteal lesions towards a DCB approach first followed by spot stent placement on indication.</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2018-02-22 19:52:44', '2018-02-22 19:52:44', '2eec0c41-3864-498b-b5ed-860917492b36'),

These devices are the forefront of new techniques for successful vessel recanalization in acute stroke treatment.</p>\n<p>As endovascular therapists, the four main lessons learnt from these trials are:</p>\n<ol><li>IV therapy is beneficial for proximal large vessel occlusions. Every single eligible stroke patient should receive IV therapy.</li><li>We must improve our patient selection for IAT. The signal of benefit from IAT is clearly smaller than was assumed. We must target proximal large vessel occlusions when there is a large volume of neural tissue at risk.</li><li>We must be faster. Reducing the time from stroke onset to recanalization is key.</li><li>We must recanalize and reperfuse more efficiently. Older generation devices tested in the trials achieved successful recanalization in &lt;50% of cases. We can now achieve unprecedented rates of successful recanalization (up to 90%). However, higher recanalization rates observed with IAT has not translated into proportionally better outcomes. These are where further opportunities lie. We have learnt the distinction between tissue reperfusion and vessel recanalization; a patent proximal vessel without restoration of the parenchymal blush and microvascular circulation is futile.</li></ol>\n<p>Moreover, in addition to selecting our patients for IAT better, establishing reperfusion as rapidly as possible, by using the best endovascular techniques to achieve the highest reperfusion success, we must also improve our clinical evaluation and assessment of IAT as a therapeutic modality. How do we accomplish all of these?</p>\n<h2>Improving patient selection</h2>\n<p>Improving patient selection remains an area of controversy. Ultimately, both clinical and imaging selection parameters should be evaluated. Patients with low NIHSS scores are probably unlikely to gain benefit from IAT irrespective of the level of vascular occlusion. Pre-procedural imaging should identify proximal large vessel occlusions, and assess the extent of established tissue injury. Clinical outcomes is strongly tied to final infarct volume — good clinical outcome is unlikely for patients with &gt;70cc infarct volume, with reperfusion of infarcts &gt;100cc likely to cause harm. These relevant threshold volumes may be much smaller for elderly patients. MRI DWI remains the gold standard for assessment of core volume; CT techniques are also widely used.</p>\n<h2>Improving treatment times</h2>\n<p>Improving treatment times requires initial stroke treatment process mapping. Measuring your clinical practice process and time metrics is a revealing exercise. Delivery of IV tPA is guided by the Golden Hour. For IAT the expectations are less clear. Comprehensive Stroke Center certification requires a generous door to IAT time of 2 hours or less, but despite this many stroke centers struggle to treat patients within this time frame. Rethinking our approach to logistics for these patients will deliver great time savings. One measure with particularly high impact is parallel workflow streams for the individual role groups involved in delivering acute ischemic stroke care. Rather than working sequentially, we can generate time savings by working concurrently. Sustained success requires a committed, multidisciplinary team.</p>\n<h2>Improving endovascular techniques</h2>\n<p>Improving endovascular techniques is a broader concept than simply using devices that reperfuse more efficiently. The field is moving toward conscious sedation instead of general anesthesia, following recent data that suggests better outcomes. Alternate techniques, such as direct aspiration using large bore intracranial catheters and the new stentreiver devices are data driven approaches to recanalization and should be universally used. Finally, the access systems used to deliver these devices to the clot face will be improved, and will allow faster groin access to reperfusion times.</p>\n<h2>Improving studies</h2>\n<p>Improving studies that evaluate IAT is the final component. We advocate better means of assessing outcomes, standardizing approaches to treatment across institutions (to allow easier and more informed comparisons) and the validation of biomarkers (e.g. time to reperfusion or final infarct volume). The recent randomized trials have produced the positive effect of galvanizing the endovascular community towards generating evidence, and have enhanced cooperation across the field as a result. We should be maximizing the effect of this.<br />\nApproaching IAT in this multifaceted and comprehensive way will achieve that ultimate of goals, improving our patients’ outcomes for severe acute ischemic stroke. IAT is a specific and potent therapy for a selected subset of patients. Applied correctly, it has a power that is almost resurrective. We are excited by the progress of the field and look forward to this next chapter of care for our stroke patients.</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2018-02-22 19:53:53', '2018-02-22 19:53:53', '71f1501d-5bfe-414a-994e-9cbcd3ba8319'),

In that time, there has been a steady rollout</p>\n<p>of devices, each equipped with a sexy new moniker.</p>\n<h3>Atherectomy: Exploring the Evidence</h3>\n<p>Despite much investment and marketing by a handful of manufacturers, atherectomy has yet to find an evidence-based niche. Though widely accepted for<br />\ndebulking of calcified lesions to allow full stent expansion, there is considerable debate over the long term patency afforded by a strategy of standalone<br />\natherectomy. Promising competing technologies, such as fracture resistant stents and drug-eluting balloons, have stolen much of the limelight. This is<br />\ndespite the built-in appeal of performing a procedure where the atheroma is actually removed from the patient, as opposed to pancaked to the vessel’s<br />\nintimal surface.</p>\n<p>Economic factors may also drive atherectomy use, with reimbursement being substantially higher for femoropopliteal atherectomy ($632.49) than stenting<br />\n($518.17), per facility prices on <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/\">www.cms.gov</a> (accessed July 12, 2013). Though personnel and equipment costs are higher<br />\nwith atherectomy than stenting, there is still an institutional financial incentive that cannot be ignored (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18296016).</p>\n<p>Atherectomy lends itself particularly well to common femoral, ostial superficial femoral and popliteal artery intervention, where stenting is unattractive,<br />\nespecially in patients that are high risk for endarterectomy. Investigations of the use of atherectomy in conjunction with drug-eluting balloons for<br />\nlesions across joints are currently underway (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23147770\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23147770</a>).</p>\n<p>What, then, could explain the hesitancy to adopt a role for atherectomy? Compared with angioplasty and stenting, atherectomies are longer, more costly and<br />\nlabor intensive. Given the greater number of moving parts (specialized guidewires, embolic protection etc) involved in the procedure, demonstrating<br />\nequivalence of atherectomy to angioplasty or stenting may not be sufficient to justify use. Though there are numerous single center registries reporting<br />\nlimb salvage rates with atherectomy alone comparable to angioplasty or stenting (75-90%), only three randomized trials have been published:</p>\n<p>Shammas <em>et al </em>(2011) compared a strategy of directional atherectomy with adjunctive angioplasty to angioplasty alone in infrainguinal disease ( <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21757372\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21757372</a>). At one year, there was no difference in target<br />\nlesion revascularization, though atherectomy reduced the need for bailout stenting.</p>\n<p>The CALCIUM 360 pilot trial (2012) compared orbital atherectomy plus angioplasty to angioplasty alone in patients with critical limb ischemia ( <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22891826\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22891826</a>). Atherectomy was associated with greater procedural<br />\nsuccess, less stent utilization and lower target vessel revascularization, though p-values did not reach statistical significance.</p>\n<p>Twelve month results of COMPLIANCE 360 show similar rates of target revascularization (and again, lower stent use) with balloon only versus orbital<br />\natherectomy in the femoropopliteal segment ( <a href=\"http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1206286\">http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1206286</a>).</p>\n<p>These trials have been criticized for qualifying the use of stents as a treatment failure. A stent-avoidant strategy has never been shown to result in<br />\nfavorable outcomes. In fact, drug-eluting stents may end up as the gold standard for endovascular therapy in the superficial femoral artery. The questions<br />\nthat need to be addressed in future trials are whether atherectomy with provisional stent placement beats a stenting only strategy and which debulking<br />\ndevice yields the best long term patency. The three categories of atherectomy tools currently approved by the FDA are described below, with examples of<br />\ndevices from each group.</p>\n<h3>Directional Atherectomy</h3>\n<p>Many operators are already familiar with the TurboHawk device (Covidien, Mansfield, MA), which excises bulky, calcified plaque using four contoured blades<br />\nand an integrated flushable collection system (<a href=\"http://www.turbohawkdevice.com/about\">http://www.turbohawkdevice.com/About</a>). Recently featured<br />\nin the DEFINITIVE LE registry presented by Lawrence Garcia at the VIVA conference in 2012, a multicenter study of 800 subjects with claudication or<br />\ncritical limb ischemia, TurboHawk atherectomy was established as a safe, effective therapy with one-year patency rates comparable to drug-eluting stents<br />\nand balloons (75.4% for SFA, 77.1% for popliteal and 89.6% for infra-popliteal, with lesion lengths of 8.1 cm, 6 cm and 5.5 cm, respectively) (<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.turbohawkdevice.com/content/downloads/def_le_12_mo_viva_garcia_28sep12.pdf\"><br />\nhttp://www.turbohawkdevice.com/content/downloads/DEF_LE_12_Mo_VIVA_Garcia_28SEP12.pdf<br />\n</a><br />\n). Limb salvage at one year in the 201-patient critical limb ischemia subset was an impressive 95%. There were acceptably low rates of distal embolization<br />\n(3.8%), flow-limiting dissection (2.3%) or perforation (5.3%).</p>\n<h3>Clinical Vignette #1</h3>\n<p>An 81-year-old wheelchair bound gentleman with a history of debilitating stroke, diabetes and hypertension presented with right foot gangrene. There were<br />\ndry punctate lesions on all five digits and the first metatarsal. The ankle vessels were not compressible and right toe brachial index was 0.39.

has been used in the peripheral arteries for well over a decade, many operators are less familiar with current<br />\niterations like the CVX-300 (Spectranetics, Colorado Springs, CO). Registry data is relatively scant compared to other modalities. However, results of the<br />\nEXCITE ISR trial, designed to show a potential novel role for laser in treatment of restenosis, are eagerly anticipated (<a href=\"http://www.spectranetics.com/patients/pad-peripheral-artery-disease/clinical-trial-enrollment\">http://www.spectranetics.com/patients/pad-peripheral-artery-disease/clinical-trial-enrollment</a>). As angioplasty is obligatory after laser atherectomy, there is a possible niche for this device in combination with drug-eluting balloons below the<br />\nknee.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Procedural cost, operator unfamiliarity and a lack of randomized comparisons with newer modalities (i.e. stenting) have hindered the widespread use of atherectomy. Many labs keep an atherectomy device on the shelf for tackling lesions that are not dilatable, and it can be an elegant solution when seeking to avoid stent placement in the common femoral or popliteal arteries. Importantly, endovascular atherectomy has not been compared to open endarterectomy in these vessels (CFA, popliteal artery). Registry studies have established the safety and efficacy of atherectomy, but carefully constructed trials will be needed to elucidate where these devices stand amongst the other new players vying for a spot in the peripheral interventionalist’s armamentarium.</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2018-02-22 20:27:47', '2018-02-22 20:27:47', '6895e53d-df39-4a45-aa49-7fa5ef769dce'),

He demonstrated all kinds of novel therapies including clot extraction and catheter-based lytic therapy—things nobody was doing and the time. I was enthralled. I thought, “that is what I want to do”. I met with the head of the Mayo Clinic at the time and ultimately designed a new curriculum for myself which included Interventional Radiology and Vascular Surgery. This then allowed me to do a full year of dedicated vascular intervention training at the Cleveland Clinic. </p>\n<p><b>How did you find Sioux Falls?</b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach: I had friends in Sioux Falls, South Dakota: I gave a talk out there while I was still working in Cleveland.  It was an integrated group that included cardiac surgeons who performed most of the vascular work.  Initially I declined when they asked if I was interested. After a few years in the Cleveland Clinic, it became clear that I needed to find a new home. I called them and I have been there for 20 years. </p>\n<p><b>Describe clinical practice in Sioux Falls? How would you describe the pace? </b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach: Last year we did 760 vascular cases. This is one of the benefits of living in a geographically isolated region with a large catchment area. </p>\n<p><b>Do you still practice coronary intervention? </b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach: I consider myself a vascular medicine guy who trained in cardiology. I rarely perform coronary intervention, though I am current developing a TAVR program and perform 4-5 TAVRs a month. </p>\n<p><b>What is your favorite vascular intervention? How many do you do a year and what devices do like to use? </b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach: Aortic endografting. I performed 90 endografts last year. When I was at Cleveland I saw the initial endograft devices being developed. I worked very hard to bring that technology to Sioux Falls and was one of the first interventional cardiologists to really take an interest in it. I have used all of the current modular devices (Cook , Medtronic, and Gore) and unibody devices, they all work very well. </p>\n<p><b>Do you preferentially use any of them?</b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach: My father drove a Ford. He liked Fords. Our neighbor liked Chevrolets. I can’t tell you that any of them shines above and beyond. There are some nuance differences, such as supra-renal fixation, which the Cook and Medtronic devices have and the Gore device does not. I don’t really see that as a drawback.  We currently do about 80% of our volume with the Gore device. </p>\n<p><b>What about newer devices such as AFX Endovascular AAA system® (Endologix, Irvine California) and Ovation® (Trivascular, Santa Rosa, California) device? </b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach: The AFX Endovascular AAA system® (Endologix, Irvine California) is a useful unibody device. When we employ snorkeling techniques to salvage the internal iliac arteries, we will often use this. Gore has some new branch preserving devices that we are currently involved with in trials. Ovation Prime™ (Trivascular, Santa Rosa, California) is interesting. We don’t use it in the acute setting (rupture) but for short necks and other scenarios it is appealing. </p>\n<p><b>Do the caliber of the devices affect how you think about them and use them? </b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach: Both the AFx™ Endovascular system and Ovation Prime™ are smaller and lend themselves to percutaneous strategies. However, I have used preclose technique for all of my endografts. Whether I go percutaneous is dictated more by common femoral artery anatomy. If you are careful and use good technique you can use percutaneous techniques with all of them. </p>\n<p><b>Moving on to lower extremity interventions, give us some insight into how you approach femoropopliteal occlusive disease? </b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach: If I can access antegrade I will. I use a 6 French sheath and either an angled glidewire or an Terumo Advantage™ (Terumo® Medical Corporation). If I have gone extraluminal, I will reenter with 0.014 CTO wires or a V18. I am “old-school” and really never use crossing devices. Perhaps this is because I am cost-conscious. I very rarely require a reentry tool, but I use the Outback when necessary. </p>\n<p><b>Do you believe in atherectomy? </b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach: Not really. I think of it like a niche device. I found that with atherectomy I was getting similar restenosis as I did with stenting, but I could place a stent in a fraction of the time. So, I rarely use atherectomy devices. I reserve its use for specific anatomical locations. Isolated short popliteal artery segments that I am trying to avoid stenting, or ostial profunda lesions in a patient with prior common femoral endarterectomy and profundaplasty. </p>\n<p><b>Would you describe yourself and a stenter or stent-minimizer? </b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach: I am a stenter. I am trying to get the best luminal result that I can at the initial presentation. I balloon and stent. I do not want to come back. We used to see short-segment SFA stenoses that responded well to balloon angioplasty, but I just don’t see those anymore. That’s not the patient population that I treat. The pattern of disease seems to have changed. I find myself looking after a sicker and older patient population with multi-level more extensive disease. </p>\n<p><b>When you stent, what do you like to use?</b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach: For routine superficial femoral arteries arteries and longer lesions I have gone with mostly Medtronic nitinol self-expanding stents. In terms of DES, I tend to use Zilver® PTX® (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana) in restenosis after seeing some of Zeller’s work. I rarely use Zilver PTX® as a first stent. There are a few other intriguing stents on the market. The SMART® stent (Cordis, Bridgewater, NJ) is interesting and easy to deploy. I am still waiting to see how they fare in the long-term. The Supera® (Abbot Vascular, Abbott Park, Ilinois) stent, which I have been deploying for a few years now, is very useful, though there is a bit of a learning curve with the device. There is a role for it when going across the adductor canal especially when I need to stent the above-knee popliteal artery, though I try to avoid the popliteal when at all possible. </p>\n<p><b>Do you enjoy critical limb ischemia?</b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach: Not really. I think of critical limb ischemia something I have to do part and parcel with providing a full service to patients. Patients with critical limb are challenging patients with a high recurrence rate and are often recalcitrant to medical therapy and risk factor modification. Overall, I find critical limb to be professionally less satisfying than other areas of vascular intervention. I don’t shy away from it, but I don’t relish it either. </p>\n<p><b>Do you use pedal access? When? </b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach: Not frequently. It is rare that I am not successful in an antegrade fashion. However, desperate measures must be taken by desperate men. In general, I am very conservative about pedal access. I will only access the pedals after an antegrade attempt has failed once or twice. Maybe this happens a handful of times a year. We used to do popliteal access, but I have largely abandoned that because sheath management can be such a problem. </p>\n<p><b>I have heard that you perform catheter directed lysis, do you think the type of catheter matters?<br />\n</b>Dr. Bacharach: No, I don’t. </p>\n<p><b>What do you think CREST II will demonstrate?</b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach: CREST II will be difficult to recruit for. I’m also concerned about the stent arm since finding experienced operators maybe difficult, compounded by the fact that many operators have such low volumes in the absence of registries. </p>\n<p><b>What is your sense of the BEST trial?</b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach: BEST could be a very important trial. However, it will be dependent on centers in which both surgical and endovascular skill are equivalent. </p>\n<p><b>What made you successful and good at what you do? </b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach: I was fortunate to have had wonderful training at the Mayo and at Cleveland. I worked hard. I was available. And I was always very passionate about what I was doing. Large volume was very helpful. It is like that old joke, “how do you get good judgment? Through experience. How do you get experience? By having bad judgment”. I made a lot of sacrifices. I missed lots of soccer games. </p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give to clinicians applying for positions in the field of vascular intervention? </b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach: Many fellows are graduating with a wealth of experiences in their respective training programs. But one has to realize that your training is never truly complete and that you are always evolving. Having the mindset that you are willing to ask for help is important. Coachability is key. We are wary of applicants who are truly overconfident and come out pounding on their chest saying “I want to do complex cases”. That is a red flag for us. </p>\n<p><b>Looking at the future of vascular intervention, do you think the future is bleak or bright? </b></p>\n<p>Dr. Bacharach:  It depends on your mindset. I think that it is bright for practitioners who are dedicated to vascular intervention and have demonstrated true interest and/or expertise. One has to be willing to see the swollen legs, the blue digits, and the odd vasculitidies. The future might be bleaker for people/coronary interventionalists who are solely interested in expanding their interventional volumes. High-volume centers don’t really want people who dabble in vascular intervention. One has to embrace vascular medicine in a more holistic way. You have to carve out an area of expertise and be recognized by your referring practitioners as someone who takes care of people beyond the bread and butter of cardiovascular medicine. With the right mindset, the future is very bright. </p>\n<p>This field is constantly changing and fascinating. The level of change in vascular intervention has been monumental and has outpaced the advancements within coronary intervention over the past decade. There will be challenges, especially cost. We have demonstrated that we can look after patients well but expensively. Can we do it cost-effectively? That will be a huge challenge for the interventionalists of the future. Overall, I am high on the future of vascular intervention.</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2018-02-22 20:28:34', '2018-02-22 20:28:34', 'bb16df43-0166-4d38-8ae8-adf825040cd5'),

 ('211', '261', 'en_us', 'Thrombolysis for Deep Vein Thrombosis', '<p>In the absence of arterial compromise, the treatment of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has long plagued clinicians. The mainstay of chronic therapy— anticoagulation—prevents clot propagation and recurrent thrombosis but offers little acute relief to patients with painful DVT and has low success rates in forestalling post-phlebitic syndrome. The alternative, thrombolysis, carries its own risks, including major bleeding and increased initial costs, but may be an important option in select patients and offer downstream economic benefits.</p>\n<p><b>Post-phlebitic syndrome</b></p>\n<p>Post-phlebitic (post-thrombotic; PPS) syndrome affects up to 20-50% of patients within two years after a DVT, despite adequate medical therapy (1). Patients experience lifestyle-limiting pain, edema, venous ectasia, hyperpigmentation, and venous ulceration; severity is typically assessed using the Villalta score, which tallies 5 symptoms and 7 clinical signs into a cumulative point total (with &gt;15 points being severe). </p>\n<p>Patients at highest risk include those presenting with initial symptoms, iliofemoral DVT, female gender, advanced age, obesity, and a history of prior DVT. Importantly patients with iliofemoral DVT who are treated with anticoagulation alone have a 2.4-fold increased recurrence rate compared with femoropopliteal DVT patients. (2) Exercise training, elastic compression stockings, and intermittent pneumatic compression have a limited role in preventing and treating PPS and cannot be used in the presence of ulceration. (3)</p>\n<p><b>Thrombolysis for post-phlebitic syndrome</b></p>\n<p>Thrombus removal may reduce rates of PPS by eliminating residual thrombus and improving vascular function. Options include operative thrombectomy or catheter-directed thrombolysis, either of which may be coupled with treatment of associated vascular stenosis or insufficiency with stenting or bypass. Catheter directed infusion improves drug delivery directly within the thrombus, and may be done with or without mechanical thrombectomy utilizing high-powered irrigation / rheolysis (e.g., AngioJet<b>©</b>, MEDRAD, PA, USA), catheter osscilation / rotation (e.g., Trellis, Covidien, MA, USA), or ultrasound enhancement (e.g., EKOS, EKOS Corporation, WA, USA).</p>\n<p>Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) has been employed for over a decade but suffers from a paucity of robust, prospective data. Retrospective and small prospective studies have shown improved quality of life measures, reduction in residual thrombus, and that elimination of thrombus correlates with positive questionnaire results. (4,5,6) The addition of mechanical thrombectomy to CDT shortens hospital stays and decreases lytic doses compared to catheter-directed lysis alone. (7) A large retrospective study of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database reviewing over 3649 cases of CDT found no improvement in in-hospital mortality, but an increase in cost ($80,094 vs. $28, 164; p&lt;0.001), blood transfusion (11.1% vs. 6.5%; p&lt;0.001), and intracranial hemorrhage (0.9% vs. 0.3%; p&lt;0.03) associated with CDT compared with propensity-matched patients with proximal DVT who were treated with anticoagulation alone. (8)</p>\n<p>On the other hand, one of the largest prospective randomized trials, CaVenT, suggested improved clinical outcomes with CDT. The trial randomized 209 patients with iliofemoral DVT to CDT vs. anticoagulation alone and found a significant reduction in PPS at 2 years (41.1% vs. 55.6%; p=0.047) as well as increased venous patency (659% vs. 47.4%; p=0.012) with only 8 patients in the CDT arm having major bleeding events. (9) </p>\n<p>A Cochrane meta-analysis of 17 trials (n = 1103) found similar results: a statistically significant reduction in PPS (RR 0.64; p&lt;0.0001) at the cost of increased bleeding (RR 2.23; p=0.0006). However, the review included 15 trials using systemic thrombolysis and only two using CDT. (10) </p>\n<p><b>The ATTRACT trial</b></p>\n<p>Important evidence on the effectiveness of catheter-directed lysis will come from the ongoing Acute Venous Thrombosis: Thrombus Removal With Adjunctive Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis trial (ATTRACT; NCT00790335). (9) The trial plans to enroll 692 patients with symptomatic proximal DVT involving the iliac, common femoral, and/or femoral vein. Participants will be randomized to anticoagulation (control) versus anticoagulation plus intrathrombus delivery of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) using one of three platforms: (a) Trellis-8 Peripheral Infusion System; (b) AngioJet Rheolytic Thrombectomy System; (c) Multisidehole infusion catheter. Anticoagulation will be initiated with heparin, enoxaparin, dalteparin, or tinzaparin followed by long-term warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). </p>\n<p>&gt;span class=\"s2\"&gt;<a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00790335\">http://clinicaltrials.gov/show...</a>. </p>\n<p><b>References</b></p>\n<p>1) S.R.

 ('213', '263', 'en_us', 'Screening ABIs in Asymptomatic Adults', '<p><b>Guideline Recommendations</b></p>\n<p>In 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPTF) updated its 2005 guidelines to state that there was insufficient evidence to support screening ankle-brachial index measurement (ABI) in asymptomatic adults, regardless of age or risk factors  (grade I statement). (1) This recommendation contradicted the endorsement made in the 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) / American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, which recommended screening all adults over age 65, regardless of symptoms or risk profile, and all adults over 50 with a history of either smoking of diabetes (class I, grade B). (2) In addition, the 2009 Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus Document on Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC-II), similar to the 2005 ACCF/AHA guidelines, had advised screening all patients &gt;70 years regardless of comorbidities and all patients &gt;50 years of age with at least one risk factor. </p>\n<p>Why the disagreement, especially over a test that has long been praised for its low cost and rapid point-of-care administration?</p>\n<p><b>Epidemiologic Studies</b></p>\n<p>Each committee highlighted different sources of evidence to justify their recommendations. </p>\n<p>The 2011 ACCF/AHA guidelines updated their screening recommendations because of a single, large observational study: the German Epidemiologic Trial on Ankle Brachial Index Study Group. (3) This study enrolled 6880 unselected adults &gt;65 years of age in Germany, all of whom were interviewed to assess for vascular disease and underwent resting ABI with a cutoff of &lt;0.90. Patients were classified as having peripheral arterial disease (PAD) if they were asymptomatic with an abnormal ABI or symptomatic with a history of intervention or amputation. </p>\n<p>With this case definition, the study found that 21% of adults over the age of 65 had some form of PAD. Of those, 12.3% were asymptomatic, and 8.7% symptomatic. About a quarter of the symptomatic patients had undergone any intervention. And symptomatic patients had a higher risk of vascular events, but not overall mortality, compared with asymptomatic patient. But, over 5 years of follow-up, asymptomatic patients with PAD had a higher overall mortality than patients without PAD (19.5 vs. 41.7 patients per 1000 patient-years; HR 1.66; 95% CI 1.38-2.00), a finding echoed in prior studies. </p>\n<p>Though this study was available to them at the time of writing, the USPTF did not reference the German Epidemiologic Trial. Instead, the committee referenced the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which showed that only 5.9% of patients &gt;40 years of age or 17.5% of patients over 75 had PAD, as defined solely by a low ABI (&lt;0.90), a less sensitive case definition. (4)</p>\n<p><b>Benefits of Early Treatment</b></p>\n<p>The USPTF paper stated, “[we] found no evidence that screening for and treatment of PAD in asymptomtic patients leads to clinically important benefits.” It further suggested that while adding ABIs to the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) results in patient risk reclassification (19% of men and 26% of women), there is uncertainty about improving clinical outcomes as a result of this adjustment. (5) USPTF primarily cites the Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis trial, which randomized 4941 asymptomatic patients with ABI &lt;0.95 to aspirin or placebo and found no significant benefit in cardiovascular outcomes (myocardial infarction, stroke, or revascularization). (6) </p>\n<p>On the other hand, the ACCF/AHA guidelines recommended aggressive risk factor modification, enhanced patient follow-up, and pharmacological therapy, with emphasis on statin (IB) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) (IIB) treatment. The Heart Protection Study included 6748 patients with PAD who did not have coronary disease; those randomized to 40mg of simvastatin benefited from a significant 25% reduction in vascular events compared with placebo. (7) Based on this and other trials showing a comparable reduction in CV events, the new 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines also recommended high-intensity statin therapy in any patient with PAD. (8)</p>\n<p><b>Discussion</b></p>\n<p>Detecting the presence of PAD is critical. Its diagnosis alters a patient’s risk profile and will cause clinicians to follow patients more closely and have a heightened sensitivity to associated conditions, especially concomitant coronary disease, which is present in &gt;60% of patients with PAD. (9) The diagnosis also helps the clinician emphasize important risk factor modification efforts, such as tobacco cessation, weight loss, exercise, and cholesterol management. Its presence may be the sole impetus to start a statin. In addition, distinguishing between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients can be challenging, particularly in patients who do not exercise enough to produce symptoms. (9) And thus screening elderly patients with a baseline risk of around 20% will likely identify both those patients who are truly asymptomatic as well as those who did not know they were symptomatic until they were actually tested. </p>\n<p><b>Take home message</b>: asymptomatic adults &gt;65 years of age regardless of risk factors or &gt;50 years of age with risk factors should be screened with a simple, office-based ankle-brachial index study</p>\n<p><b>References</b></p>\n<p>(1) Moyer VA; U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

PAD is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis. The three cardinal manifestations of atherosclerosis are coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease  and PAD. Once a patient is diagnosed with PAD, they are at higher risk of suffering future MI, stroke or death. </p>\n<p>PAD affects 8-12 million Americans, second only to coronary artery disease. The prevalence of PAD increases with age. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or NHANES, found the prevalence of PAD among patients age 40 years or older in the United States was 4.3%; for patients age 70 or older, the prevalence of PAD was 14.5%. The PAD Awareness, Risk, and Treatment: New Resources for Survival Program, or PARTNERS program, included patients either more than 70 years old or between 50 to 69 years old and with diabetes or a history of smoking. When common risk factors were included in the population, the prevalence of PAD was approximately 29%, or 1/3 of all patients. Smoking, diabetes, HTN and elevated cholesterol are the strongest risk factors for developing PAD.</p>\n<p>Gender Differences in Prevalence of PAD</p>\n<p>According to one series of 6880 pts from 344 primary practices in Germany from 2004, the prevalence of PAD in females was greater than men in those &gt;85 yrs of age (6). However, according to pooled data from 6 registries (over 24,000 pts), PAD prevalence was slightly higher in men within all age groups. Unfortunately, published series are often marred by selection bias and many feel that the true burden of PAD (defined by ABI &lt; 0.9 obtained from U.S. Census 2010 data) may be the most reliable indicator of disease prevalence in the U.S. In a study adopted by Hirsch et al., the burden of PAD was higher in women over the age of 70 as compared to men. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the diagnosis of PAD represents the tip of the iceberg. PAD is a marker of systemic atherosclerosis, a major predictor of future MI, CVA and death. Unfortunately, few studies have reviewed potential gender-specific mortality differences in PAD. In one study adapted from data collected by the ABI Collaboration study (480, 325 person years: 24, 955 men and 23,339 women), overall rates of CVD and mortality were similar in men and women, however both major CV events and mortality  were significantly  increased in women as compared to men with more advanced disease (ABI &lt; 0.7 or &gt; 1.4). </p>\n<p>Due to the limited data and awareness of PAD in women, the American Heart Association, in collaboration with the Vascular Disease Foundation (and its “Peripheral Arterial Disease Coalition”), commissioned the AHA/PAD coalition to urge healthcare professionals to promptly establish PAD in women ‘at risk’ and to incorporate PAD-specific risk messages within current women’s health clinics in an effort to raise community awareness. </p>\n<p><b>Summary Points:</b></p>\n<p>Gender and age-specific prevalence of PAD has not been clearly defined from published population based studies. </p>\n<p>Although the age-dependent prevalence of PAD in adult women may be lower than men, <b>the total population burden of PAD appears to be higher in women</b>, particularly in those over age of 70. </p>\n<p>All pts with <b>PAD are more likely to die</b> from CHD events than those without PAD. </p>\n<p>There is a <b>Trend towards higher CV mortality, all-cause mortality and major CV event rates in women</b> with abnormal ABI (&lt; 0.7, &gt; 1.4). </p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p>1.

However, studies have shown that most patients with PAD are asymptomatic (50%), or present with atypical symptoms (33%). In fact, asymptomatic PAD is very common in women. According to the Women’s Health and Aging Study (WHAS), 63% of those over the age of 65 with ABI &lt; 0.9 had noexertional leg symptoms. In the Walking and Leg Circulation Study (WALCS), a cohort of 460 PAD participants in the Chicago area, women were more than 2X’s more likely to report the presence of atypical exertional leg symptoms that sometimes began at rest. </p>\n<p>Therefore, the vast majority of patients with PAD may be missed based on history and physical alone, highlighting the importance of further screening for PAD (i.e. use of ABI’s) in high risk populations- and in particular women. In fact, the updated ACC/AHA guidelines in 2011 suggest obtaining ABI’s in at risk populations defined by those who are 70 years and older, or who are 50 years and older with a history of smoking or diabetes (Level of Evidence 1B). </p>\n<p>Currently, there are no known gender-based differences in the diagnostic sensitvity or accuracy of the physiologic or classic image-based diagnostic PAD tests.  Arterial diameters in women are smaller than age matched diameters in men, and it is unclear if these anatomic differences may have some effect on gender-specific treatment outcomes. </p>\n<p>PAD Treatment in Women</p>\n<p>The goals of PAD treatment are two-fold: to improve the affected limb (in presence of debilitating symptoms of critical limb ischemia) and to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with PAD. Limb-related improvement can be assessed by improvement in walking ability and prevention of progression to CLI and amputation.</p>\n<p>Decreases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality include decreased mortality from MI, stroke, and cardiovascular death, as well as decreased risk of nonfatal MI and stroke.</p>\n<p>Although women with PAD have greater functional impairment than men with PAD, women may be less likely to undergo lower extremity revascularization than men</p>\n<p>In one study by Feinglass et al, men were more than twice as likely to be selected for revascularization despite similar baseline comorbidites and prevalence of limb salvage indications.</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2018-02-22 20:31:10', '2018-02-22 20:31:10', 'c4412c93-856c-4557-8935-f181a5320c2c'),

There is, however, very limited data with regards to the efficacy of statins particularly in the subgroup of patients with CLI.</p>\n<h3>What were the main results?</h3>\n<p>After adjusting for baseline differences using propensity weighting, statin therapy was associated with better outcomes, primarily driven by a lower rate of mortality at follow-up. Interestingly, statin use was also associated with improved lesion patency among patients undergoing infrapopliteal angioplasty.</p>\n<h3>What where the study strengths and limitations?</h3>\n<p>This study is the first to report major outcomes of statin use in patients with CLI, effectively reinforcing the existing guidelines in the treatment of patients with PAD. While the study showed a clear difference in mortality, it was not powered to detect a difference in individual outcomes such as amputation, myocardial infarction or stroke. Lastly, despite the authors’ best attempt to control for measured confounding variables using propensity score weighting, the retrospective and nonrandomized nature of the study makes it difficult to eliminate other biases.</p>\n<h3>Perspective</h3>\n<p>In patients with critical limb ischemia, the use of statins is likely beneficial and may perhaps be associated with better outcomes after infrapopliteal angioplasty.

It should be noted, however, that if a patient is post-procedure and unstable the right place to go is back to the cath lab, and not to the CT suite. Going to the CT suite may result in loss of precious time. Once the presence of hematoma is confirmed by CT, the patient should be taken immediately to the endovascular suite for localization and treatment of the source of bleeding (as in the clinical vignette). Alternatively, any patient showing signs of a retroperitoneal hematoma while still on the cath table should undergo femoral angiography at the access sitePerforations can be managed with close observation (as in Appendix – Clinical Vignette) or immediate contralateral access and intervention.</p>\n<h2>Endovascular Therapy for a retroperitoneal hemorrhage</h2>\n<p>Options for endovascular repair are covered stent (for iliac or femoral arteries) or coil embolization (for small vessel perforations). In emergencies, it is best to use whichever of these techniques is most readily available and familiar. Important considerations for stent graft placement include oversizing by 1-2 mm to ensure sealing, avoiding the common femoral bifurcation and preparing for balloon occlusion in the common iliac if difficulties are encountered, leading to a prolonged procedure in a rapidly decompensating patient. When embolization is chosen, coils should be deployed on both sides of a perforation to prevent re-bleeding from dissection propagation or distal retrograde flow via abdominal collaterals.</p>\n<h2>When is surgery needed for the treatment of a retroperitoneal hemorrhage</h2>\n<p>Surgery may be necessary in cases where endovascular therapy fails and bleeding continues despite intervention. In these cases, direct visualization and ligation of the bleeding artery may be necessary, with abdominal packing to prevent ongoing hemorrhage. Abdominal compartment syndrome can develop as the result of a large hematoma. Early surgery (i.e. before trial of conservative treatment, followed by angiography and intervention if necessary) is frowned upon, as removing a retroperitoneal hematoma may relieve tamponade and exacerbate bleeding. It may also be difficult to localize the source of bleeding in the operating room, whereas in the angiography (or hybrid) suite a perforation may be more readily visualized.</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2018-02-22 20:33:15', '2018-02-22 20:33:15', '09dbe8b8-76be-4588-8fdc-fdc006eecd12'),

 ('223', '273', 'en_us', 'Emerging Therapies for Pulmonary Embolism', '<p>Anticoagulation is the first-line therapy for all forms of pulmonary embolism. Systemic thrombolysis is also effective for those pulmonary embolism patients with shock, but it comes at a cost of increased bleeding ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15262836). There is less certainty regarding the optimal treatment for patients with submassive pulmonary embolism, defined as the subset of patients that are hemodynamically stable with evidence of right heart strain. Several trials seeking to add clarity for this “gray zone” have been recently published.<br />\nClinical Vignette<br />\nA 47 year-old male with no medical history presented with dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain to a local ER. His blood pressure was 135/60, heart rate was 108 bpm, and his oxygen saturation was 94% on 2L oxygen per nasal cannula. He has recently been on a 12 hour transatlantic flight for business. A CT showed bilateral main pulmonary artery embolism. His troponin was mildly elevated, and echocardiography revealed right heart strain. You reviewed treatment options with him, and elected to proceed with catheter-directed thrombolysis . Based on recent randomized controlled data, which of the following has not been demonstrated with the use of systemic or catheter-direced thrombolysis for PE?<br />\nReduced risk of death or hemodynamic compromise during the acute, in-hospital setting<br />\nImproved quality of life and functional capacity at 3 months<br />\nImprovement in right heart strain parameters at 24 hours<br />\nReduced risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism long-term</p>\n<h3>Systemic Thrombolysis</h3>\n<p>Two trials examining systemic, full-dose thrombolysis for submassive pulmonary embolism have been recently reported.<br />\nIn PEITHO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716681), patients were randomized to anticoagulation versus anticoagulation plus tenecteplase. The primary endpoint, death or hemodynamic collapse at 7 days, was significantly reduced in the tenecteplase group (2.6% vs. 5.6%, P=0.02). This benefit was driven by a reduction in hemodynamic collapse but not mortality, and bleeding risk was higher in the tenecteplase group including intracranial hemorrhage (hemorrhagic strokes- 10 vs. 1). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that patients TOPCOAT (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24484241) randomized patients to anticoagulation versus anticoagulation plus tenecteplase. The primary endpoint was a composite of: in-hospital death, clinical deterioration, or bleeding or poor quality-of-life, reduced functional capacity, or recurrent pulmonary embolism at 90 days. The primary endpoint was significantly reduced in the tenecteplase group (15% vs. 37%, P=0.02), with the bulk of the benefit being driven by improvements in functional capacity or health perception of patients. This trial was terminated prematurely due to funding issues after randomizing approximately half of the intended sample size.<br />\nMOPETT (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23102885) was a unique trial that examined “safe dose” thrombolysis for patients with non-massive pulmonary embolism. Not all of the patients included had submassive pulmonary embolism (eg approximately 2/3 had elevated cardiac markers). Patients were randomized to anticoagulation versus anticoagulation plus safe dose thrombolysis, defined as 50 mg of TPA for patients &gt;50 kg and 0.5 mg/kg for patients Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis<br />\nHigher rates of bleeding have been reported with systemic thrombolysis in large pulmonary embolism trials. Catheter-directed thrombolysis may be theoretically advantageous since much lower doses of thrombolytics may be administered to achieve the same therapeutic effect, and catheter-directed delivery may allow for higher concentrations of drug to associate with thrombus leading to faster clot dissolution.<br />\nULTIMA (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24226805) randomized patients with submassive pulmonary embolism to anticoagulation versus anticoagulation plus catheter-directed thrombolysis. The primary endpoint was the change in right ventricle to left ventricle ratio (marker of right heart strain) at 24 hours following initiation of therapy. Catheter-directed thrombolysis was effective in reducing the primary endpoint, but clinical outcomes including mortality and recurrent venous thromboembolism were similar at 90 days. Bleeding was non-significantly higher in the catheter-directed thrombolysis group.<br />\nSEATTLE II was a single arm prospective trial of ultrasound assisted lysis for submassive pulmonary embolism (Piazza G. A Prospective, single-arm, multicenter trial of ultrasound-facilitated, low-dose fibrinolysis for acute massive and submassive pulmonary embolism (SEATTLE II). Program and abstracts of the American College of Cardiology Scientific Session; March 29-31, 2014; Washington, DC. Late-breaking clinical trial). The preliminary presented results of this study showed a similar safety profile as the ULTIMA study had, and again similar efficacy as far as surrogates to patient status including right ventricular size and pulmonary arterial pressure improvement.<br />\nSeveral recent meta-analyses including one published in JAMA by a group led by Dr. Jay Giri (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24938564) included many of the aforementioned studies and came to the conclusion that thrombolysis resulted in improved patient outcome after submassive PE, however at the price of increased risk of major bleeding. Two main limitations of these analyses were that they mixed systemic and catheter directed data and that net-clinical benefit was highly dependent on the weight placed on intracranial hemorrhage.</p>\n<h3>Case Vignette Revisited</h3>\n<p>Of the choices listed, answer #4 is correct. PEITHO demonstrated a reduced risk or death or hemodymamic collapse at 7 days with use of systemic thrombolysis for intermediate-risk PE. MOPETT demonstrated improved quality-of-life measures for patients treated with “safe dose” thrombolytics.ULTIMA demonstrated that catheter-directed thrombolysis improves right ventricular function, as assessed by a surrogate marker of right heart strain (RV/LV ratio). The literature to date has yet to demonstrate reductions in hard cardiovascular enpoints including mortality or recurrent venous thromboembolism, though such data may be forthcoming through additional trials or longer term follow up of those already published. Pending the arrival of such data, the decision to use catheter-directed thrombolysis should be individualized, with an open acknowledgment of the current evidence gaps.</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2018-02-22 20:34:14', '2018-02-22 20:34:14', '0c7e0d12-6e65-47ce-9a58-d89106ed8e0d'),

 ('225', '275', 'en_us', 'Paget-Schrotter Syndrome or Effort Thrombosis: What is the most current treatment?', '<h3>Clinical Vignette:</h3>\n<p>A 41-year-old female presented to hospital with a swollen, painful right upper extremity, which had been progressive over several days. The patient was an avid athlete who performed vigorous upper body exercised on a regular basis. Initial work up including upper extremity ultrasound confirmed right subclavian vein DVT (figure 1). She had no personal or family history of thrombophilia, and screening blood work was unremarkable. Chest X ray (figure 2) did not show evidence of a cervical rib. Based on her presentation a discussion ensued with her physicians as to the best management. Ultimately, given the time frame of the thrombus, of which the acute episode appeared to be only several days time, angiography with possible catheter direct thrombolysis (CDT) was offered to the patient.</p>\n<p>Angiography noted both acute and chronic features: it confirmed 100% thrombotic occlusion of the subclavian vein at the level of the first rib (figure 3). Additionally there appeared to be collateralization, which had formed allowing for drainage into the SVC. However, given the acute presentation and progressive, significant symptoms, further intervention was attempted.</p>\n<p>The lesion was crossed easily with an 0.035 stiff angled glide wire, and an EKOS catheter (Ekosonic Endovascular) was placed uneventfully with tPA infusing at 1mg/hr overnight (figure 4). This catheter combines a traditional lytic catheter with side holes, with a tiny ultrasound filament, which is postulated to assist in clot fragmentation. The patient was also treated with adjunctive aspirin and heparin.</p>\n<p>Repeat angiography 24 hours later revealed some recanalization of the vessel and was treated with adjunctive Angiojet therapy (Medrad) and subsequent balloon angioplasty with a 9.40mm Foxcross balloon (Abbott Vascular). Final angiography revealed the vessel to be fully recanalized (Figures 5-7). The patient was then referred on to Vascular surgery for consideration of rib resection in the setting of this current event.</p>\n<h3>Approach to patients with effort thrombosis:</h3>\n<p>The issue of “effort thrombosis” arises from an anatomical abnormality of the thoracic outlet that predisposes patients to compression of the axillary and subclavian venous system. This syndromes goes by various names including: venous thoracic outlet syndrome, Paget-Schroetter syndrome, “spontaneous” thrombosis of the upper extremity, or effort thrombosis.</p>\n<p>Congenital features such as cervical rib, extra muscle, or abnormalities of tendon insertion may cause it. Secondary causes can include a fracture at the site, or muscle hypertrophy from repetitive exercise (ie. rowing, weight lifting, pitching). Additionally, extremes of motion, or repetitive motion alone can create a nidus for this condition. Given this, the presentation is most commonly seen in young, athletic patients.</p>\n<p>Physical exam will be remarkable for swelling of the affected extremity, however, based on the chronicity of the process, one may appreciate the formation of venous collaterals on the upper chest of the affected side (Urschel’s sign). Depending on the severity of compression, features of brachial plexus compression may also be present. Evaluation and examination should include careful assessment for the possibility of pulmonary embolism progressing from this condition.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in the above vignette, imaging is essential to the diagnosis of this condition.<br />\nCXR is helpful to rule out obvious anatomic causes however, sometimes until the patient undergoes surgical exploration, the immediate anatomic cause is not readily apparent. Vascular ultrasound is extremely helpful in solidifying this diagnosis, with angiography still as the gold standard for assessment.</p>\n<p>If no apparent anatomic cause is found then consideration of screening for thrombophilia or malignancy is warranted.</p>\n<h3>A departure from the guidelines?</h3>\n<p>Given that this is a less common presentation of DVT, there have been no randomized trials evaluating different treatment algorithms for this disorder, leading much of the management to case reports and expert opinion (1).</p>\n<p>Given the lack of high quality evidence based trials in this area, the most recent ACP Chest guidelines still place anticoagulation alone as the strongest recommendation (2). However, combining expert consensus, case reports, and the most current ACP guidelines, several hallmarks of treatment have been forwarded:<br />\nRegardless of cause, a minimum of 3 months of anticoagulation should be considered<br />\nArm compression with an arm sleeve and elevation of the extremity may help with symptomatic relief<br />\nIf the acute presentation is felt to be less than 14 days old, strong consideration should be given to catheter directed thrombolytic therapy<br />\nAn initial endovascular approach may include catheter directed lytic therapy, percutaneous thrombectomy, and balloon angioplasty, but should not include stenting as an initial strategy. Until the mechanical obstruction is relieved, the present of stent will increase the risk of rethrombosis<br />\nSurgical referral for removal of the mechanical issue which lead to the event</p>\n<p>In the current era, there is evidence to suggest that if an aggressive approach to this condition is taken, the incidence of post thrombotic syndrome may be decreased from 53% to 12- 25% (3)</p>\n<p>Given the lack of randomized clinical trials, many areas of controversy remain regarding patient management including:<br />\nthe true benefit of lytic therapy over heparin therapy<br />\nwhether or not adjunctive therapies such as EKOS system and others have any additional benefit in this population<br />\nthe dose and duration of lytic therapy<br />\nthe timing of surgical decompressive therapy (in hospital, versus at 3 months post anticoagulation)<br />\nthe best treatment of the affected vein post decompressive therapy (stenting versus a surgical approach)</p>\n<p>Given these controversies this area remains rich for further study. However current expert consensus recommends an aggressive strategy in this young, active patient population. It is hoped that future guidelines will seek to address a more unified consensus opinion than the current anticoagulation guidelines.</p>\n<h4>References:</h4>\n<p>Illig KA, Doyle AJ.

That is, target vessel revascularization is based on the ‘angiosome concept’.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.angiologist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Angiosome-angiography.jpg\" class=\"image-popup\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11019\" alt=\"Angiosome angiography\" src=\"http://www.angiologist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Angiosome-angiography-300x147.jpg\" style=\"background-attachment:scroll;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);background-image:none;background-repeat:repeat;border-bottom-color:rgb(226,226,226);border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(226,226,226);border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1px;border-right-color:rgb(226,226,226);border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1px;border-top-color:rgb(226,226,226);border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1px;color:rgb(210,41,29);font-size:16px;height:144.3px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-top:0px;max-width:294.5px;padding-bottom:6px;padding-left:6px;padding-right:6px;padding-top:6px;vertical-align:baseline;\" width=\"300\" height=\"147\" /></a><br /></p><p>1A, B) Left below-knee angiogram showing critically diseased anterior tibial artery supplying a dorsalis pedis artery, patent peroneal artery, and distally occluded posterior tibial artery. 1C, D) Since the nonhealing wound was felt to be in the angiosome of the posterior tibial artery, this vessel was revascularized.</p>\n<p>The figure is from a case of an 85 year-old man with nonhealing, left heel wound for 6 months.

In a retrospective study of 329 patients with critical limb ischemia followed for a mean of 18 months, those who underwent revascularization according the angiosome concept had more favorable limb outcomes (4). After propensity score matching, freedom from amputation was 82% +/-5% for limbs that were successfully revascularized according to the angiosome concept but 68% +/-5% (p=0.01) for the group with indirect revascularization (4). Similar benefits were seen in a retrospective series of 48 patients with non-healing wounds who underwent tibioperoneal bypass (5).</p>\n<h2>Limitations of the angiosome concept</h2>\n<p>First, more evidence is needed to firmly support angiosome-guided revascularization. Second, it is not always technically feasible to revascularize the artery supplying a wound. Third, the ability to achieve revascularization in the angiosome of interest may be a surrogate for less severe disease, rather than a sign of true therapeutic benefit. Despite these limitations, it is our practice to pursue angiosome-guided revascularization if technically feasible based on the available evidence and the biologic plausibility of clinical benefit.</p>\n<h2>References about angiosomes</h2>\n<ol><li>Slovut DP, Sullivan TM.

It is performed using the TurboHawk or SilverHawk devices manufactured by covedian. More details on the device including a video on how it works is available on the covedian website (http://www.turbohawkdevice.com/About).</p>\n<p>Clinical rationale behind DA and DEFINITE LE Study:</p>\n<p>POBA is largely limited by poor long-term patency rates and stenting leaves a re-stenotic nidus as well as limits future surgical bypass targets at the stented segment site. Therefore novel technologies such as DA have been designed to reduce atheroma burden at specific sites as well as preserve future surgical targets and the natural conformability of the vessel. The challenge that plagues such novel technologies is a lack of patient level data on their effectiveness and safety.</p>\n<p>DEFINITE LE is a promising first step in addressing this knowledge gap for directional atherectomy (DA) devices. It is an industry funded (covedian) prospective, multinational, single-arm study designed to evaluate the short and long term (12-month) safety and effectiveness of DA for percutaneous treatment of 598 subjects with claudication and 201 subjects with critical limb ischemia (CLI) across 47 sites in the U.S. and Europe. Primary outcome was primary target lesion patency at 12 months for claudicants and freedom from major unplanned amputation of the target limb at 12 months in subjects with CLI. Both angiographic and duplex core lab adjudication was performed.</p>\n<p>Key Findings in DEFINITE LE:</p>\n<p>Limb preservation was achieved in 95% of CLI patients (much higher compared to contemporary surgical cohorts).<br />\nPrimary one-year target vessel patency was 78% in claudicants (comparable to contemporary stent trials).<br />\nAlarmingly high (5.3%) arterial perforation rate with a stent bailout rate of 3.2%.<br />\nInterestingly, non-inferiority of this revascularization strategy in diabetic versus non-diabetic claudicants was demonstrated.<br />\nNo difference in distal embolization with or without a filter but the overall distal embolization (3.8%) rate was too small to detect a statistical difference.</p>\n<p>Take Home Points from DEFINITE LE:</p>\n<p>Despite highly experienced operators, a high rate of arterial perforations in DEFINITE LE raises the need for enhancing device safety and further investigation is needed to refine patient selection in order to maximize clinical benefit with DA.</p>\n<p>Overall, DA is a promising new technology but given single arm study design we still need randomized comparative data on safety and efficacy prior to embracing DA in routine clinical practice.</p>\n<p>Given increasing cost considerations, one possible suggestion for future randomized trials in this field would be to embed them within existing large databases such as the newly launched ACC/NCDR PVI registry.</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2018-02-22 20:37:21', '2018-02-22 20:37:21', '2f661d42-8c2a-47c2-b4b2-ac4b89b50f02'),

Traditionally, outcome assessment in clinical trials for this patient population has focused on amputation-free survival and patency. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2128012/pdf/9448521.pdf\">Choosing the optimal outcome</a> that is important to patients with CLI and their providers will be crucial in designing a valid and generalizable trial that adds meaningfully to the evidence base.</p>\n<h2>Traditional outcomes</h2>\n<p><em>Amputation-free survival</em> is an unavoidably, important ‘hard’ outcome for trials of CLI. In fact, major trials (such as <a href=\"http://www.angiologist.com/?p=10816\">BEST</a>) are likely to be powered for this or a similar endpoint. However, limb therapies probably only affect the amputation component of this composite outcome, as mortality in CLI patients is often due to cardiac causes (1). In addition, amputation-free survival does not always correspond to a patient being ambulatory and living independently. Revascularization is a cornerstone in the management of patients with CLI. However, <em>patency</em> – another traditional outcome — does not preclude limb salvage. In a meta-analysis of 30 studies (2557) patients with CLI undergoing below-knee revascularization, 1-year patency following endovascular therapy was only 58.1 +/- 4.6%, but limb salvage was 86 +/- 2.7% (2). As a corollary, patency does not ensure the optimal clinical outcome. In a series of 1012 patients undergoing infra-inguinal bypass for CLI, 20% of those with patent grafts at 1 year remained symptomatic or had undergone amputation (3). Though important for the clinical care of patients with critical limb ischemia, lower extremity hemodynamics (eg., ankle-brachial indices) is a surrogate for patency in many respects.</p>\n<h2>Functional Outcomes after Critical Limb Ischemia therapy</h2>\n<p>Treadmill testing protocols (graded and constant load) and 6-minute walk tests have been well studied in patients with claudication and also have good test characteristics (4). However, is it reasonable to expect a patient with a painful wound that is appropriately dressed and offloaded to walk on a treadmill? Is loss of distance walked post intervention a treatment failure for a CLI patient if that patient is still able to walk at all and live independently? Other functional tests are also being studied in patients with CLI such as the summary performance score (composite of 4-meter walk test, balance test, sit-stand test), vertical accelerometry, and isometric muscle strength measurements (5).</p>\n<h2>Patient reported outcomes</h2>\n<p>Multiple patient-reported outcomes have been studied in peripheral arterial disease. Some of these instruments are disease-specific; that is, they were derived and validated in populations with peripheral artery disease. Examples include the Walking Impairment Questionnaire, the Nottingham Health Profile, PADQOL, and VASCUQOL. However, no questionnaire has been designed specifically for CLI patients, excluding claudicants.</p>\n<h2>Wound healing as an outcome of critical limb ischemia therapy</h2>\n<p>Wound healing is an important limb outcome for CLI trials. The definition of wound healing is typically a wound that remains healed for 2 weeks. Core labs exist for the assessment of wound healing. The time to wound healing and the resources required to achieve wound healing (revascularization procedures, surgical debridements, totality of wound care) should be considered.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, there are challenges in choosing the optimal outcome assessment tools when designing a trial of CLI therapies. Amputation-free survival is likely to always be of interest. Refining the functional assessment of patients with CLI with non-walking functional tests, such as those listed above, may be of use. Developing a CLI-specific questionnaire that assesses quality of life and function would improve outcome assessment in this disease. Constructing an endpoint of ‘limb health’ — comprised of wound healing, function, and lack of pain – would be of value when comparing therapies in CLI patients. Eventually, cost-effectiveness analyses will be important after optimal management strategies and outcome assessments have been better elucidated.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ol><li>Becker F, Robert-Ebadi H, Ricco JB, Setacci C, Cao P, de Donato G, et al.

The goal is to encourage more scientific research in this area and, ultimately, fund scientists to make discoveries that advance the care and improve the quality of life for of people with vascular diseases.</p>\n<p>“Vascular disease is prevalent in the U.S. and rates are likely to grow with our aging population,” said Ivor Benjamin, M.D. FAHA, president elect of the American Heart Association, the world’s leading voluntary health organization devoted to fighting cardiovascular disease and stroke. “The therapeutic landscape for these conditions is on the cusp of evolution with the promise of discoveries that can improve diagnosis and treatment of peripheral vascular diseases and favorably impact disease outcomes.”</p>\n<p>Both VIVA Physicians, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to advancing the field of vascular medicine, and American Heart Association understand the significance of supporting early career scientists. In addition to funding meritorious research to advance vascular science, the American Heart Association - VIVA Physicians Research Awards will offer training and mentorship to potential future leaders in cardiovascular and stroke research focused on vascular issues.</p>\n<p>“The mission of VIVA Physicians is to advance the care of patients with vascular disease,” says John Kaufman MD., VIVA Physicians board president. “With this grant program, we hope to encourage more scientific research and discovery in this arena. We are proud to work with the American Heart Association in the shared goal of advancing research to improve patient lives.”</p>\n<p>Vascular diseases, including atherosclerotic peripheral vascular and <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/VascularHealth/AorticAneurysm/Your-Aorta-The-Pulse-of-Life_UCM_475411_Article.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">aortic diseases</a> are prevalent in the U.S. and other nations. More than 202 million people worldwide, including more than eight million in the U.S. age 40 and older, suffer from <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/PeripheralArteryDisease/Peripheral-Artery-Disease_UCM_002082_SubHomePage.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">peripheral artery disease</a> (PAD), which impacts peripheral arteries to the legs, stomach, arms and head - most commonly the legs. The reduced blood flow associated with PAD can damage cells and tissue in the limbs, organs and even in the brain. PAD can lead to walking difficulty and increased leg pain with walking, called claudication. People with PAD are at risk of complications including infections and amputation. Additionally, individuals with PAD have significantly higher rates of major adverse cardiovascular events including heart attack, stroke and death.</p>\n<p>Interested early career investigators should <a href=\"http://professional.heart.org/professional/ResearchPrograms/ApplicationInformation/UCM_316909_Application-Information.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">submit an application</a> for the American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship or Career Development Award via <a href=\"https://research.americanheart.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Grants@heart.org</a>.

Jaff, DO, and Kenneth Rosenfield, MD<\\/b><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><b>Vascular Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston<\\/b><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>We know a lot about pulmonary emboli (PE). We know that that, though the risk for PE increases with each decade over the age of 40 (1), there is no adult patient population that is immune to the potentially devastating manifestations of PE. From a recent review of the risk of venous thromboemboli during or following prolonged air travel, we know that patients with one or more risk factors for PE should wear graduated compression stockings, avoid dehydration and be considered for pharmacoprophylaxis (2).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>From the guidelines of our medical societies, we have recommendations for treatment of PE in many scenarios. For example, the American College of Chest Physicians recently updated its guidelines to recommend systemic thrombolytic therapy over catheter-based therapy for patients with only PE and hypotension (3), and the European Society of Cardiology recommends \\u201cprimary reperfusion\\u201d for the treatment of PE patients at high- and intermediate-high risk (4). Recent data support the use of systemic thrombolytic therapy for PE (5). We\\u2019ve learned so much that today there is little debate about the management of hemodynamically stable, minimally symptomatic PE patients. For these patients, the only controversy is which anticoagulant is most appropriate.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So, yes, we know a lot. Unfortunately, there\\u2019s a lot we still need to learn.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/viva365.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/PERT-2015.jpg\\\" class=\\\"image-popup\\\"><img class=\\\"size-large wp-image-511 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/viva365.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/PERT-2015-1024x680.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"PERT 2015\\\" width=\\\"746\\\" height=\\\"495\\\" srcset=\\\"http:\\/\\/viva365.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/PERT-2015-1024x680.jpg 1024w, http:\\/\\/viva365.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/PERT-2015-300x199.jpg 300w, http:\\/\\/viva365.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/PERT-2015-768x510.jpg 768w, http:\\/\\/viva365.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/PERT-2015.jpg 1600w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px\\\" style=\\\"margin: 10px auto 20px; padding: 6px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(226, 226, 226); outline: 0px; max-width: 95%; height: auto; display: block; clear: both; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; border-radius: 2px; box-shadow: rgb(209, 209, 209) 1px 2px 1px;\\\"><\\/a><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>For starters, we don\\u2019t know the best treatment for \\u201csubmassive\\u201d or \\u201cmassive\\u201d PE. The options for treating these patients are almost as numerous as the opinions of the specialists who contribute to managing these conditions. We know about the challenges: bleeding risk; the often devastating impact of PE on long-term survival; the costs associated with advanced PE therapies; and that our institutions, many of them already stretched thin, struggle to identify patients who might have PE and then to perform rapid and definitive tests and treatments for those who present during \\u201coff-hours.\\u201d<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>From our successes with acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) and stroke teams, we know that the key to successfully reducing morbidity and mortality from PE likely lies in learning how to improve our systems so that we rapidly deploy the right team of providers at the right time. Pulmonary Embolus Response Teams (PERT) have been described as a means to achieve that goal (6), and data regarding patient management within an institution offering care through such teams has been published (7).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/viva365.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/Pert-2015-2.jpg\\\" class=\\\"image-popup\\\"><img class=\\\"size-large wp-image-510 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/viva365.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/Pert-2015-2-1024x680.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Pert 2015 2\\\" width=\\\"746\\\" height=\\\"495\\\" srcset=\\\"http:\\/\\/viva365.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/Pert-2015-2-1024x680.jpg 1024w, http:\\/\\/viva365.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/Pert-2015-2-300x199.jpg 300w, http:\\/\\/viva365.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/Pert-2015-2-768x510.jpg 768w, http:\\/\\/viva365.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/Pert-2015-2.jpg 1600w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px\\\" style=\\\"margin: 10px auto 20px; padding: 6px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(226, 226, 226); outline: 0px; max-width: 95%; height: auto; display: block; clear: both; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; border-radius: 2px; box-shadow: rgb(209, 209, 209) 1px 2px 1px;\\\"><\\/a><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>However, as skeptics have suggested, we don\\u2019t know enough about the costs of running PERT programs. We don\\u2019t yet know if risks ensue when such programs are dominated by specialists who perform PE interventions. Despite the demonstrated benefits of acute stroke and STEMI teams, we don\\u2019t yet have enough data to confirm the value of PERT programs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Again, there\\u2019s a lot we don\\u2019t know, and therefore, there\\u2019s a lot for us to debate. If you manage PE patients, please join us at the Massachusetts General Fireman Vascular CME Symposium on Pulmonary Embolism on June 28-29, 2016. There, you will see world-renowned experts coming come together to examine what we know and what we don\\u2019t know, and to debate the knowledge gaps and how best to fill them.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Yes, there\\u2019s a lot we don\\u2019t know about this all-too-common and potentially deadly condition.

Such data does not exist regarding VTE.

Edoxaban demonstrated significantly less major bleeding and lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage compared to warfarin. However, there was a significant increase in gastrointestinal bleeding events with edoxaban versus warfarin.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The recommended dose of edoxaban for non-valvular atrial fibrillation is 60 mg once daily. Creatinine clearance should be assessed before initiating therapy with edoxaban.&nbsp; In patients with creatinine clearance between 15 ml\\/min and 50 ml\\/min, the dose should be reduced to 30 mg daily.&nbsp; It is important to note that edoxaban has not been studied in patients with mechanical heart valves or moderate or severe mitral stenosis, and therefore, it is not recommended in these patients.&nbsp; As with any anticoagulant, the premature discontinuation of edoxaban in the absence of alternative anticoagulation can increase the risk of ischemic events.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The approval for use in venous thromboembolism patients was based on the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.nejm.org\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1056\\/NEJMoa1306638\\\">Hokusai venous thromboembolism study<\\/a>&nbsp;published in the&nbsp;<em>New England Journal of Medicine<\\/em>&nbsp;in October 2013. This study randomized 8,292 patients with DVT or PE to receive warfarin or edoxaban. Edoxaban was non-inferior to warfarin in reducing the rates of recurrent VTE, 3.2% versus 3.5%, respectively.&nbsp; Edoxaban was also associated with a significant decrease in the primary safety outcome of first or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding compared to warfarin, 8.5% vs 10.3%, respectively (p=0.004).&nbsp; &nbsp;For patients with normal renal function, the recommended dose of edoxaban is 60&nbsp;mg once daily following 5-10 days of a parenteral anticoagulant. For patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 mL\\/min and 50 mL\\/min, who weigh less than or equal to 60 kg, or who are on concomitant p-glycoprotein inhibitors, the recommended dose of edoxaban is 30 mg once daily following a parenteral anticoagulant.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Two important points were noted as part of the Hokusai-VTE study that may set edoxaban apart from other new oral anticoagulants:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul><li>Use of a parenteral agent. Because the Hokusai-VTE trial included a run-in phase with a parenteral agent (unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin), edoxaban is not approved without the use of a parenteral agent for the first 5-10 days. &nbsp;This is in contrast to both&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.xareltohcp.com\\/sites\\/default\\/files\\/pdf\\/xarelto_0.pdf\\\">rivaroxaban<\\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/packageinserts.bms.com\\/pi\\/pi_eliquis.pdf\\\">apixaban<\\/a>, two other oral Xa inhibitors.<\\/li><li>Use in severe pulmonary embolism. While rivaroxaban, apixaban and dabigatran have been poorly studied in the setting of high-risk pulmonary embolism, there is some data to suggest that edoxaban is effective in this subset of patients. RV dysfunction was found in over 34% in both the edoxaban and warfarin groups.&nbsp; The authors speculated that the run-in with a parenteral agent encouraged clinicians to enroll patients with severe VTE edoxaban more frequently than in the other novel oral anticoagulant studies<\\/li><li>Less clinically relevant bleeding than warfarin. There was a signal that showed superiority for clinically relevant bleeding (major and minor). This signal did not exist for the analysis examining major bleeding alone. A&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/circ.ahajournals.org\\/content\\/131\\/1\\/82.full.pdf\\\">small phase I trial<\\/a>published in January 2015 in&nbsp;<em>Circulation<\\/em>&nbsp;showed that bleeding measures could be reversed by administration of 4 factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) in patients who received edoxaban.

Since its first symposium in 2003, VIVA has provided state-of-the-art education for physicians with an interest and commitment to vascular and endovascular medicine. VIVA\'s unique Laptop Learning system has allowed participants to engage in pre- and post-testing to determine their level of knowledge and gauge their improvement over the week of VIVA\'s annual conference. We have pooled these questions and added many more, as well as provided explanations of correct and incorrect answers to create a true study guide. This is designed not only for those physicians interested in sitting for the American Board of Vascular Medicine General and Endovascular board certification examinations, but also as a guide for any physicians who care for patients with vascular disease.

Jaff, DO; Ido Weinberg, MD; Beau Hawkins, MD<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The Vascular and Endovascular Medicine Study Guide is a 10-year compilation of examination questions and content from Vascular InterVentional Advances (VIVA) and other expert contributors. Since its first symposium in 2003, VIVA has provided state-of-the-art education for physicians with an interest and commitment to vascular and endovascular medicine. VIVA\'s unique Laptop Learning system has allowed participants to engage in pre- and post-testing to determine their level of knowledge and gauge their improvement over the week of VIVA\'s annual conference. We have pooled these questions and added many more, as well as provided explanations of correct and incorrect answers to create a true study guide. This is designed not only for those physicians interested in sitting for the American Board of Vascular Medicine General and Endovascular board certification examinations, but also as a guide for any physicians who care for patients with vascular disease. Features:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul><li>Five comprehensive practice exams, each containing approximately 50 multiple choice questions<\\/li><li>Complete answer explanations for further understanding of each question<\\/li><li>Full color images of scans, tests, and patient conditions<\\/li><li>Ideal review for the American Board of Vascular Medicine examinations<\\/li><\\/ul>\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/dp\\/0615696449\\/ref=cm_sw_su_dp\\\" class=\\\"angle-link\\\">Purchase<\\/a><\\/p>\",\"180\":\"<p><strong>COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW IN VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR TEXTBOOK<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><em>Editors of the book are David P.

Jaff, DO, and Kenneth Rosenfield, MD<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Vascular Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>We know a lot about pulmonary emboli (PE). We know that that, though the risk for PE increases with each decade over the age of 40 (1), there is no adult patient population that is immune to the potentially devastating manifestations of PE. From a recent review of the risk of venous thromboemboli during or following prolonged air travel, we know that patients with one or more risk factors for PE should wear graduated compression stockings, avoid dehydration and be considered for pharmacoprophylaxis (2).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>From the guidelines of our medical societies, we have recommendations for treatment of PE in many scenarios. For example, the American College of Chest Physicians recently updated its guidelines to recommend systemic thrombolytic therapy over catheter-based therapy for patients with only PE and hypotension (3), and the European Society of Cardiology recommends \\u201cprimary reperfusion\\u201d for the treatment of PE patients at high- and intermediate-high risk (4). Recent data support the use of systemic thrombolytic therapy for PE (5). We\\u2019ve learned so much that today there is little debate about the management of hemodynamically stable, minimally symptomatic PE patients. For these patients, the only controversy is which anticoagulant is most appropriate.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So, yes, we know a lot. Unfortunately, there\\u2019s a lot we still need to learn.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/viva365.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/PERT-2015.jpg\\\" class=\\\"image-popup\\\"><img class=\\\"size-large wp-image-511 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/viva365.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/PERT-2015-1024x680.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"PERT 2015\\\" width=\\\"746\\\" height=\\\"495\\\" style=\\\"margin:10px auto 20px;padding:6px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;border-color:rgb(226,226,226);height:auto;clear:both;\\\"><\\/a><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>For starters, we don\\u2019t know the best treatment for \\u201csubmassive\\u201d or \\u201cmassive\\u201d PE. The options for treating these patients are almost as numerous as the opinions of the specialists who contribute to managing these conditions. We know about the challenges: bleeding risk; the often devastating impact of PE on long-term survival; the costs associated with advanced PE therapies; and that our institutions, many of them already stretched thin, struggle to identify patients who might have PE and then to perform rapid and definitive tests and treatments for those who present during \\u201coff-hours.\\u201d<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>From our successes with acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) and stroke teams, we know that the key to successfully reducing morbidity and mortality from PE likely lies in learning how to improve our systems so that we rapidly deploy the right team of providers at the right time. Pulmonary Embolus Response Teams (PERT) have been described as a means to achieve that goal (6), and data regarding patient management within an institution offering care through such teams has been published (7).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/viva365.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/Pert-2015-2.jpg\\\" class=\\\"image-popup\\\"><img class=\\\"size-large wp-image-510 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http:\\/\\/viva365.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/Pert-2015-2-1024x680.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Pert 2015 2\\\" width=\\\"746\\\" height=\\\"495\\\" style=\\\"margin:10px auto 20px;padding:6px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;border-color:rgb(226,226,226);height:auto;clear:both;\\\"><\\/a><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>However, as skeptics have suggested, we don\\u2019t know enough about the costs of running PERT programs.

Despite the demonstrated benefits of acute stroke and STEMI teams, we don\\u2019t yet have enough data to confirm the value of PERT programs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Again, there\\u2019s a lot we don\\u2019t know, and therefore, there\\u2019s a lot for us to debate.

Edoxaban demonstrated significantly less major bleeding and lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage compared to warfarin. However, there was a significant increase in gastrointestinal bleeding events with edoxaban versus warfarin.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The recommended dose of edoxaban for non-valvular atrial fibrillation is 60 mg once daily. Creatinine clearance should be assessed before initiating therapy with edoxaban.&nbsp; In patients with creatinine clearance between 15 ml\\/min and 50 ml\\/min, the dose should be reduced to 30 mg daily.&nbsp; It is important to note that edoxaban has not been studied in patients with mechanical heart valves or moderate or severe mitral stenosis, and therefore, it is not recommended in these patients.&nbsp; As with any anticoagulant, the premature discontinuation of edoxaban in the absence of alternative anticoagulation can increase the risk of ischemic events.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The approval for use in venous thromboembolism patients was based on the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.nejm.org\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1056\\/NEJMoa1306638\\\">Hokusai venous thromboembolism study<\\/a>&nbsp;published in the&nbsp;<em>New England Journal of Medicine<\\/em>&nbsp;in October 2013. This study randomized 8,292 patients with DVT or PE to receive warfarin or edoxaban. Edoxaban was non-inferior to warfarin in reducing the rates of recurrent VTE, 3.2% versus 3.5%, respectively.&nbsp; Edoxaban was also associated with a significant decrease in the primary safety outcome of first or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding compared to warfarin, 8.5% vs 10.3%, respectively (p=0.004).&nbsp; &nbsp;For patients with normal renal function, the recommended dose of edoxaban is 60&nbsp;mg once daily following 5-10 days of a parenteral anticoagulant. For patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 mL\\/min and 50 mL\\/min, who weigh less than or equal to 60 kg, or who are on concomitant p-glycoprotein inhibitors, the recommended dose of edoxaban is 30 mg once daily following a parenteral anticoagulant.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Two important points were noted as part of the Hokusai-VTE study that may set edoxaban apart from other new oral anticoagulants:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul><li>Use of a parenteral agent. Because the Hokusai-VTE trial included a run-in phase with a parenteral agent (unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin), edoxaban is not approved without the use of a parenteral agent for the first 5-10 days. &nbsp;This is in contrast to both&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.xareltohcp.com\\/sites\\/default\\/files\\/pdf\\/xarelto_0.pdf\\\">rivaroxaban<\\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/packageinserts.bms.com\\/pi\\/pi_eliquis.pdf\\\">apixaban<\\/a>, two other oral Xa inhibitors.<\\/li><li>Use in severe pulmonary embolism. While rivaroxaban, apixaban and dabigatran have been poorly studied in the setting of high-risk pulmonary embolism, there is some data to suggest that edoxaban is effective in this subset of patients. RV dysfunction was found in over 34% in both the edoxaban and warfarin groups.&nbsp; The authors speculated that the run-in with a parenteral agent encouraged clinicians to enroll patients with severe VTE edoxaban more frequently than in the other novel oral anticoagulant studies<\\/li><li>Less clinically relevant bleeding than warfarin. There was a signal that showed superiority for clinically relevant bleeding (major and minor). This signal did not exist for the analysis examining major bleeding alone.

The results show that at 24 months, 75.9% of patients treated with Stellarex maintained blood flow through the treated segment of the diseased artery, assessed through blinded core-lab adjudicated patency. Only 61.0% of patients treated with an uncoated balloon still maintained blood flow at 24 months. The data shows that Stellarex demonstrates higher efficacy and patency results, and longer treatment durability compared to an uncoated balloon, which is the current standard of care in <span class=\\\"xn-location\\\">the United States<\\/span>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\\"The Stellarex DCB produced durable results in this rigorous trial, validating earlier findings among the ILLUMENATE trial series,\\\" stated <span class=\\\"xn-person\\\">Marianne Brodmann<\\/span>, M.D. \\\"These consistent, top-tier outcomes are achieved with a low-dose balloon.* Stellarex is the first low-dose DCB to demonstrate a significant treatment effect at two years.\\\"<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The ILLUMENATE EU RCT has independent evaluation including supervision by a clinical events committee, a data safety and monitoring board, and assessment by angiographic and duplex ultrasound core laboratories. Philips Spectranetics fully funded the ILLUMENATE EU RCT as part of the ILLUMENATE series of five trials to evaluate the benefits of Stellarex .035\\\" for various patient groups in comparison to an uncoated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon, which is the current endovascular standard of care. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\\"We are committed to providing proven clinical solutions that positively impact patient outcomes,\\\" stated <span class=\\\"xn-person\\\">Christopher Barys<\\/span>, Image Guided Therapy Devices Business Leader for Philips. \\\"We are proud to have the only low-dose drug-coated balloon with a proven treatment effect at two years compared to the current endovascular standard of care in the U.S. The addition of Stellarex in the Philips portfolio through the Spectranetics acquisition reinforces our commitment to helping physicians decide, guide, treat and confirm the right therapy for their patients.\\\"<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The Stellarex drug-coated balloon is designed to restore and maintain blood flow to arteries in patients with peripheral arterial disease.

Marianne Brodmann, M.D., of the Medical University of Graz in Austria, presented the data today as a late-breaking trial at the Vascular Interventional Advances (<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/vivaphysicians.org\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">VIVA 17<\\/a>) Annual Conference. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The ILLUMENATE EU RCT, which is part of a series of five trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of Stellarex for superficial femoral artery and popliteal disease, includes 328 PAD patients from 18 centers across Germany and Austria and compares the Stellarex DCB to an uncoated angioplasty balloon. The results show that at 24 months, 75.9% of patients treated with Stellarex maintained blood flow through the treated segment of the diseased artery, assessed through blinded core-lab adjudicated patency. Only 61.0% of patients treated with an uncoated balloon still maintained blood flow at 24 months. The data shows that Stellarex demonstrates higher efficacy and patency results, and longer treatment durability compared to an uncoated balloon, which is the current standard of care in the United States.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\\"The Stellarex DCB produced durable results in this rigorous trial, validating earlier findings among the ILLUMENATE trial series,\\\" stated Marianne Brodmann, M.D. \\\"These consistent, top-tier outcomes are achieved with a low-dose balloon.* Stellarex is the first low-dose DCB to demonstrate a significant treatment effect at two years.\\\"<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The ILLUMENATE EU RCT has independent evaluation including supervision by a clinical events committee, a data safety and monitoring board, and assessment by angiographic and duplex ultrasound core laboratories. Philips Spectranetics fully funded the ILLUMENATE EU RCT as part of the ILLUMENATE series of five trials to evaluate the benefits of Stellarex .035\\\" for various patient groups in comparison to an uncoated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon, which is the current endovascular standard of care. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\\"We are committed to providing proven clinical solutions that positively impact patient outcomes,\\\" stated Christopher Barys, Image Guided Therapy Devices Business Leader for Philips. \\\"We are proud to have the only low-dose drug-coated balloon with a proven treatment effect at two years compared to the current endovascular standard of care in the U.S. The addition of Stellarex in the Philips portfolio through the Spectranetics acquisition reinforces our commitment to helping physicians decide, guide, treat and confirm the right therapy for their patients.\\\"<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The Stellarex drug-coated balloon is designed to restore and maintain blood flow to arteries in patients with peripheral arterial disease.

Women in the registry were older and had smaller aneurysms, narrower proximal aortic neck diameters, shorter nonaneurysmal aortic neck lengths, greater infrarenal angulation, and smaller bilateral iliac artery diameters. Successful delivery and deployment of the Endurant stent graft was achieved in equal numbers of women and men. Through 5 years, there were no aneurysm-related mortalities or ruptures in women; and the rate of freedom from secondary endovascular procedures was similar between the two genders (women, 85.6%; men, 84.1%). At 5 years, the combined rate of abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter stability and shrinkage was similar between genders (women, 89.6%; men, 89.4%).&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><b>About VIVA Physicians <br><\\/b><i>VIVA Physicians strive to be the premier educators in the field of vascular medicine and intervention.

The rate of new symptomatic PE through 12 months was 0 percent (0\\/129). There were no instances of filter tilting, migration, embolization, fracture, IVC perforation through 12 months or device-related deaths. The rate of successful Sentry bioconversion was 95.7 percent at six months and 96.4 percent at 12 months, an improvement over published retrieval rates.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Two-Year Results from the IN.PACT Global Study<br><\\/strong>Presented by Thomas Zeller, M.D.<br>IN.PACT Global is a multicenter, international, prospective, single-arm study designed to expand on clinical evidence with the In.Pact Admiral drug-coated balloon (DCB) (Medtronic) for the treatment of real-world patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal disease. To date, IN.PACT Global is the largest independently adjudicated DCB study of real-world patients with femoropopliteal artery disease. Two-year results demonstrate consistent and durable clinical performance, and confirm the positive results observed in the IN.PACT SFA randomized trial.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Insights from the Zilver PTX Study in Japan<br><\\/strong>Presented by Michael Dake, M.D.<br>The first 900 patients in Japan treated with drug-eluting stents were enrolled in the Zilver PTX study. Nine hundred and five patients with 1,080 lesions were enrolled at 95 institutions. Comorbidities included a high incidence of chronic kidney disease (44 percent) and critical limb ischemia (21 percent). The current study continues to show positive outcomes through four years. For the challenging subgroups evaluated, results were similar and favorable through two years, indicating that the Zilver PTX DES may be a valid treatment option for patients with these difficult-to-treat lesions.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Primary Patency of the BioMimics 3D Helical Stent: Significant Outcome from the Mimics Study<br><\\/strong>Presented by Thomas Zeller, M.D.<br>The BioMimics 3D helical stent (Veryan Medical, Ltd.) has a 3D helical centerline designed to impart nonplanar curvature to the vessel, promoting swirling blood flow. The study randomized 76 patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease 2:1 to either BioMimics 3D or LifeStent (Bard Peripheral Vascular). A statistically significant difference was observed in primary patency through 24 months. These data support the BioMimics 3D helical stent in primary stenting of complex lesions and point to potential for complementary use with DCBs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Four-Year Results of the IN.PACT SFA Trial: Drug-Coated Balloon Catheter vs. an Uncoated Balloon Catheter in Femoropopliteal Lesions<br><\\/strong>Presented by Peter Schneider, M.D.<br>IN.PACT SFA enrolled 331 patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal lesions.&nbsp; Four-year results of the IN.PACT SFA trial demonstrated sustained treatment effect in maintaining significantly higher freedom from CD-TLR by KM estimate in patients treated with the In.Pact Admiral DCB compared to PTA despite a late catch-up effect.

BASIL evaluated 452 patients with limb ischemia, although only a minority actually received treatment randomization, and concluded that surgery was better in patients with more than 2 years anticipated survival.&nbsp; Overall amputation-free survival (AFS) was approximately 70% in both treatment cohorts.&nbsp; However, polytetrafluorethylene grafts (PTFE) had an almost 40% lower amputation free survival at five years compared to saphenous vein bypass, and of the 85% of patients who were not suitable for randomization the principle reason was absence of a viable conduit for bypass.&nbsp; Endovascular therapy was preferred in patients with lower anticipated survival, and was associated with fewer ICU days and, as a result, lower costs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>BASIL Enrolled patients from 1999 to 2004.&nbsp; In the decade since the BASIL trial was completed, numerous additional devices and strategies have emerged for the treatment of CLI pts, and BASIL may therefore not necessarily reflect contemporary outcomes with endovascular therapy.&nbsp; Single device trials have found comparable AFS rates.&nbsp; In the Excell Trial evaluating below knee bare metal stents, amputation was avoided in 70% of Rutherford 6 patients, and nearly 100% of Rutherford 4 patients at 12 months (2).&nbsp; Primary patency for drug-eluting stents has ranged from 80-85%, albeit for short lesions (3-5).&nbsp; Atherectomy has reported one year patency rates of 78% using the Silverhawk Device (Covidien, Mansfield, MA), and 66% for occlusions averaging 10 cm in length (6).&nbsp; In the Calcium 360 trial, orbital atherectomy (Diamondback, CSI, Minneapolis MN) was associated with a less than 7% one-year target lesion revascularization (TLR); TLR rates were 20% in the angioplasty alone arm (7).&nbsp; Finally, recent drug coated balloon data has also supported highly acceptable patency rates; initial experience with infrapopliteal paclitaxel coated balloon angioplasty for long tibial lesions found 3-month restenosis in one-quarter of patients, complete wound healing in three of four, and limb salvage in more than 95% (8).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>What do comparative studies inform us regarding the relative merits of surgery or endovascular therapy?&nbsp;&nbsp; In a retrospective analysis, Zhan et al found equivalent improvements in limb perfusion as measured by toe pressures at a mean follow-up of 13- (surgical group) to 15- (endovascular group) months.&nbsp; Major amputation was 11% in both treatment cohorts (9).&nbsp; A propensity-score analysis of 1023 CLI patients compared 208 matched pairs of patients with follow-up out to five years following surgery or below-knee angioplasty.&nbsp; Equal benefits were reported in both groups for repeat revascularization (21% surgery, 18% endo), subsequent bypass (5% vs. 12%), and major amputation (19% vs 17%) (10). This data and changing patient demographics since the BASIL trial have resulted in endovascular therapy being adopted as a first-line strategy in traditional surgical groups.&nbsp; One recent study reported endovascular therapy as the initial treatment in 70% of patients referred for surgical evaluation (11).&nbsp; An evaluation of 295 endovascularly-treated and 138 bypass patients (1\\/2 with autologous vein grafts) found no differences in primary-, assisted-, or secondary patency, amputation-free survival or limb salvage.&nbsp; However, procedural mortality in the surgical group was more than double (6.0 vs 2.8%) (11).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The currently enrolling Best Endovascular Strategy (BEST-CLI) trial, sponsored by the National Institute of Health, will provide additional and important data regarding long-term measurable outcomes in CLI patients randomized by treatment allocation.&nbsp; Results are not expected for at least five years.&nbsp; However, as with all large prospective randomized-controlled trials, a critical review will be necessary to determine the generalizability of the BEST-CLI results due to the large potential for randomization bias.&nbsp; For now, there is strong support for endovascular therapy first in CLI patients.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>References<\\/h2>\\r\\n<ol><li>Adam DJ, Beard JD, Cleveland T, Bell J, Bradbury AW, Forbes JF, Fowkes FG, Gillepsie I, Ruckley CV, Raab G, Storkey H; BASIL trial participants. <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/16325694\\\">Bypass&nbsp;versus&nbsp;angioplasty&nbsp;in&nbsp;severe&nbsp;ischaemia&nbsp;of the&nbsp;leg&nbsp;(BASIL): multicentre, randomised controlled trial.<\\/a> 2005 Dec 3; 366(9501):1925-34.<\\/li><li>Rocha-Singh KJ, Jaff M, Joye J, Laird J, Ansel G, Schneider P;&nbsp;VIVA&nbsp;Physicians.&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/22605682\\\">Major adverse limb events and wound healing following infrapopliteal artery&nbsp;stent&nbsp;implantation in patients with critical limb ischemia: the XCELL&nbsp;trial.<\\/a> Catheter Cardiovasc Interv. 2012 Nov 15;80(6):1042-51<\\/li><\\/ol>\\r\\n<ol><li>Rastan&nbsp;A, Tepe G, Krankenberg H, Zahorsky R, Beschorner U, Noory E, Sixt S, Schwarz T, Brechtel K, B\\u00f6hme C, Neumann FJ, Zeller T. <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/21622669\\\">Sirolimus-eluting&nbsp;stents&nbsp;vs. bare-metal&nbsp;stents&nbsp;for treatment of focal lesions in infrapopliteal arteries: a double-blind, multi-centre, randomized clinical trial.<\\/a> Eur Heart J. 2011 Sep;32(18):2274-81<\\/li><li>Scheinert&nbsp;D, Katsanos K, Zeller T, Koppensteiner R, Commeau P, Bosiers M, Krankenberg H, Baumgartner I, Siablis D, Lammer J, Van Ransbeeck M, Qureshi AC, Stoll HP; ACHILLES Investigators. <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/23194941\\\">A prospective randomized multicenter comparison of balloon angioplasty and infrapopliteal stenting with the sirolimus-eluting&nbsp;stent&nbsp;in patients with ischemic peripheral arterial disease: 1-year results from the ACHILLES trial.<\\/a> J Am Coll Cardiol. 2012 Dec 4; 60(22):2290-5.<\\/li><li><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/?term=McMillan%20WD%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=20961774\\\">McMillan&nbsp;WD<\\/a>1,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/?term=Leville%20CD%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=20961774\\\">Leville CD<\\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/?term=Long%20TD%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=20961774\\\">Long TD<\\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/?term=Gomes%20M%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=20961774\\\">Gomes M<\\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/?term=Groffsky%20JL%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=20961774\\\">Groffsky JL<\\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/?term=Schultz%20SR%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=20961774\\\">Schultz SR<\\/a>.

Thus, only Edoxaban may be considered in patients with submassive pulmonary embolism.Without evidence from randomized control trials that NOACs are non inferior to warfarin in these patient populations, warfarin therapy remains standard of care.<\\/li><li>Cancer patients mandate specific attention. The trials which have compared NOACs to warfarin included only a small number of cancer patients. Furthermore, there have been to date no trials comparing new oral anticoagulants with low molecular weight heparin in patients with active cancer. Thus enoxaparin remains the standard for cancer related VTE events.<\\/li><li>Novel oral anticoagulants should also likely be avoided in gastric bypass patients. Without a predictable way of monitoring NOACs, there is no clear way of assessing absorption in this patient population and importantly these patients were not specifically studied.<\\/li><li>Another group to avoid with NOAC therapy are patients who exhibit poor compliance with warfarin monitoring. In these patients inability to monitor NOACs may be a problem as providers will no be clearly able to assess therapeutic levels.<\\/li><li>Finally, patients whose creatinine level may change over time should not be offered NOACs as all are effected by renal clearance.<\\/li><\\/ol>\\r\\n<h2>Conclusions<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Though NOACs clearly have a place in current management of VTE, long-term data on these agents is still lacking. In many subsets of patients as outlined above warfarin will remain as the standard of care for VTE.<\\/p>\",\"216\":[\"230\"],\"2\":\"\"}}', '2018-02-22 19:43:49', '2018-02-22 19:43:49', 'bebca28a-5d13-4a1a-9ba4-7493f2bcf4b9'),

Once bleeding is noticed at the access site, an additional 1-2 cc of air is used to inflate the balloon so that the bleeding stops. This allows having sufficient pressure to achieve hemostasis without occluding the blood flow through the artery. The band is kept in place for 30 minutes and then slowly decompressed over 5-10 minutes and removed if no bleeding is observed. Patients are allowed to mobilize at this time. Access site patency is checked.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Follow up<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Our practice is to evaluate the access site with clinical examination by the physician at 1 week and with duplex ultrasound at 1 month.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Our Experience<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>We recently presented our data of consecutive 80 patients approached via this novel technique. Access was successfully obtained in 74 (92%). A total of 8 (10%) patients required femoral access for various reasons including failure to obtain pedal access, spasm or need for additional support. Out of 80 patients 51 patients required intervention of which 45 (88%) were performed via pedal access only. Most notably there were no complications in these patients. Access site evaluation at 1 month was available in 71 of 74 patients accessed as 3 patients were lost to follow up. All 71 patients had patent access site and no complications were observed. <\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Discussion<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Primary pedal access may be a safe and feasible alternative to traditional femoral approach. Pedal access has several advantages.<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol><li>Reduced rate of complications associated with femoral approach.<\\/li><li>Reduced procedure time. (less tortuosity compared to contra-lateral femoral approach).<\\/li><li>Reduced radiation exposure due to shorter procedure time and less scatter radiation from lower extremity compared to abdomen. <\\/li><li>Shorter recovery time and early ambulation may increase patient comfort.<\\/li><\\/ol>\\r\\n<p>In published literature major retrospective case series have explored different methods of retrograde approach. Recently Mustapha et al described their technique in a case-series of 23 patients who were thought to be high risk of groin complications as primary approach. They had no access site complications similar to our study. Walker et al described the largest reported case series of 228 CLI patients with retrograde approach after failed antegrade approach. In this series there was one access site occlusion and two pseudo-aneurysms requiring covered stent placement (1.3% complication rate). Montero-Baker and colleagues had described 51 cases, including 6 claudicants, with pedal access after failed antegrade approach and reported 1 access site occlusion, two perforations and hematomas.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Our technique is extrapolated from our extensive trans-radial experience as interventional cardiologist and learning curve might be longer for those who lack these skills. Also pedal access has limitations including significant lesions in below the knee arteries which may require treatment prior to approaching lesions above the knee. <\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Conclusion<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>In our limited single center experience primary pedal approach seems safe and feasible. In future further analysis with comparison to femoral approach will shed more light on superiority of this approach.  Our access site success, rate of complications and procedural success is in line with previously reported case series utilizing retrograde approach.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>References<\\/h2>\\r\\n<ol><li>Allison MA, Ho E, Denenberg JO, Langer RD, Newman AB, Fabsitz RR, Criqui MH.

Once bleeding is noticed at the access site, an additional 1-2 cc of air is used to inflate the balloon so that the bleeding stops. This allows having sufficient pressure to achieve hemostasis without occluding the blood flow through the artery. The band is kept in place for 30 minutes and then slowly decompressed over 5-10 minutes and removed if no bleeding is observed. Patients are allowed to mobilize at this time. Access site patency is checked.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Follow up<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Our practice is to evaluate the access site with clinical examination by the physician at 1 week and with duplex ultrasound at 1 month.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Our Experience<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>We recently presented our data of consecutive 80 patients approached via this novel technique. Access was successfully obtained in 74 (92%). A total of 8 (10%) patients required femoral access for various reasons including failure to obtain pedal access, spasm or need for additional support. Out of 80 patients 51 patients required intervention of which 45 (88%) were performed via pedal access only. Most notably there were no complications in these patients. Access site evaluation at 1 month was available in 71 of 74 patients accessed as 3 patients were lost to follow up. All 71 patients had patent access site and no complications were observed. <\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Discussion<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Primary pedal access may be a safe and feasible alternative to traditional femoral approach. Pedal access has several advantages.<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol><li>Reduced rate of complications associated with femoral approach.<\\/li><li>Reduced procedure time. (less tortuosity compared to contra-lateral femoral approach).<\\/li><li>Reduced radiation exposure due to shorter procedure time and less scatter radiation from lower extremity compared to abdomen. <\\/li><li>Shorter recovery time and early ambulation may increase patient comfort.<\\/li><\\/ol>\\r\\n<p>In published literature major retrospective case series have explored different methods of retrograde approach. Recently Mustapha et al described their technique in a case-series of 23 patients who were thought to be high risk of groin complications as primary approach. They had no access site complications similar to our study. Walker et al described the largest reported case series of 228 CLI patients with retrograde approach after failed antegrade approach. In this series there was one access site occlusion and two pseudo-aneurysms requiring covered stent placement (1.3% complication rate). Montero-Baker and colleagues had described 51 cases, including 6 claudicants, with pedal access after failed antegrade approach and reported 1 access site occlusion, two perforations and hematomas.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Our technique is extrapolated from our extensive trans-radial experience as interventional cardiologist and learning curve might be longer for those who lack these skills. Also pedal access has limitations including significant lesions in below the knee arteries which may require treatment prior to approaching lesions above the knee. <\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Conclusion<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>In our limited single center experience primary pedal approach seems safe and feasible. In future further analysis with comparison to femoral approach will shed more light on superiority of this approach.

Initially focused on confirming that acute limb ischaemia (ALI) is indeed the culprit pathology, intravenous heparin is commenced to counter the risk of thrombus propagation. <\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Assessing acute limb ischemia<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>The physician must be cognizant of the many pathologies that may cause ALI but equally that in the clear majority the cause will result from in situ thrombosis of the native vessel, embolism (usually cardiogenic) or thrombosis of a lower limb bypass graft. Clues may include history of AF\\/recent AMI, claudication, PAD\\/previous bypass surgery. The circulatory examination will include all pulses upper and lower limb and their nature, the precordium, abdomen, global neurological function and most importantly lower limbs. Examine the contralateral lower limb for evidence of intact pulses and emboli then focus on the affected limb, once again examining for pulses, color, temperature, old scars, neurological function (motor and sensory), compartmental tension\\/pain and Doppler signals both arterial and venous. This process allows the physician to determine the Rutherford category of ALI (I, Viable; IIa, Threatened\\/Marginal; IIb ,Threatened\\/Immediate; III, Major tissue\\/Nerve damage Inevitable) which in turn determines the best approach to treatment.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Choosing the right treatment for acute limb ischemia<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Stage I can be treated electively after imaging, much as with IC\\/CLI. Stage III is likely to require amputation or in some cases palliation, unless presentation is very early. Stage IIa can be imaged with angiography\\/CTA prior to determine the best strategy, whereas IIb requires immediate revascularisation to avoid permanent nerve damage and\\/or extensive tissue loss. Catheter directed thrombolysis (CDT) has the advantage of being less invasive, as well as facilitating convenient angiographic imaging and supplemental endovascular therapy if required. It is therefore preferred when there is adequate time, the patient is frail or run-off is thrombosed and there are no contraindications to thrombolysis. Surgical thrombo-embolectomy is preferred when timely revascularisation is needed, proximal vessels\\/bypass grafts are involved with preservation of run-off or the duration of ischemia goes beyond 14 days. There are an array of pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy methods that offer a timely and less invasive solution for revascularisation.

The natural evolution of PE ranges significantly, with abrupt hemodynamic compromise and death within one hour for approximately 10% of all cases. In contrast, approximately one third of patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) present with asymptomatic PE . The pathophysiologic consequences of an acute PE are primarily hemodynamic and manifest when approximately 30-50% of the pulmonary bed is obstructed. When this obstruction approaches 75%, the right ventricle (RV) must acutely generate a systolic pressure above 50 mm Hg, which a normal ventricle cannot accommodate. This leads to RV ischemia and dysfunction, and in severe cases, septal shift resulting in left ventricular obstruction and significant hypotension . Early mortality  is closely linked to the probability of recurrent PE with an associated death rate of approximately 25%.  This cascade of events can progress rapidly, and if unrecognized and untreated, PE mortality approaches approximately 30%. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\tAlthough certain clinical signs and symptoms can help to guide the clinician towards the diagnosis of PE, these are often nonspecific and lack adequate positive or negative predictive value for conclusive diagnosis. Therefore, several objective measures should be employed to help risk stratify patients into massive (high), submassive (intermediate) and nonmassive (low) PE categories . A patient meets criteria for massive PE when they present with systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg (or a systolic pressure decrease greater than 40 mm Hg from baseline) for greater than 15 minutes. Additional  criteria for massive PE include persistent hypotension requiring pressor support, pulselessness or persistent bradycardia (less than 40 bpm). Submassive PE criteria include evidence of RV dysfunction, RV chamber dilation (either by echocardiogram or computed tomography), EKG changes or elevated biomarkers (troponin I or T, or brain naturietic peptide).  Nonmassive PE do not meet criteria for either massive or submassive PE. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\t Early risk stratification for patients with PE is essential as mortality dramatically increases with escalating level of risk. Early mortality exceeds 15% for patients who meet criteria for massive PE. Within this subgroup, mortality approaches 70% for those who require cardiopulmonary resuscitation vs approximately 25% for patients who present with shock .  Even within the submassive PE subcategory, RV dysfunction alone is associated with a 3 to 15% early mortality risk.  An RV diameter\\/LV diameter ratio greater than 0.9 on chest CT is associated with an 82% thirty day adverse event rate (odds ratio 4.0) . This also portends to long term consequences as dysfunction that does not resolve at hospital discharge is associated with 13% risk of PE-related mortality at three years . In contrast there is a 4% three year mortality for patients with resolved RV dysfunction at hospital discharge. Other findings on echocardiogram can also indicate poor prognosis, including severe RV free wall hypokinesis with sparing of the apex (McConnell\\u2019s sign), pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid regurgitation, and RV thrombus. Cardiac biomarkers also assist with short term prognostication where the odds ratio for short term mortality is 5.9 for patients with elevated troponin , and is 9.5 and 5.7 for patients who present with elevated BNP or pro-BNP , respectively.  Non massive PE carry significant less mortality burden, with &lt;1% of patients experiencing early death. \\r\\nThe long term all-cause mortality of acute PE is significantly linked to concurrent clinical parameters which include advanced age, malignancy, neurodegenerative disease, chronic renal disease and cardiovascular disease . Approximately one-third of all patients who suffer a PE will die within 5 years and the predominant cause of long term mortality is associated cardiovascular disease. Finally, it is important to consider longstanding pulmonary hypertension due to chronic thromboembolic disease, affecting approximately 0.5-3% of all patients who experience PE . \\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>References<\\/h3>\\r\\n<ol><li>Stein P, Matta F, Musani M, Diaczok B.

Despite improvements in operative techniques and peri-operative care, open repair of aortic arch aneurysms is still plagued by significant morbidity and mortality. Endovascular approaches have significantly altered our approach to aortic arch disease, with the hopes of diminishing complications and mortality. When considering endovascular repair, however, there are many notable obstacles that must be overcome in order to achieve successful exclusion of the aneurysm. Some of these mandates are not unique to endovascular repair of the arch, such as the need for adequate length and diameter of the proximal and distal seal zones. Some obstacles, however, are unique to the arch and include the potential difficulty of navigating through tight arches, maneuvering near the aortic valve, preventing stroke, and maintaining perfusion of the great vessels. Initial approaches to endovascular repair have relied upon extra-anatomic debranching of the arch, with inflow to the great vessels transitioned to a site away from the intended seal zones. These debranching techniques have included bypasses using the ascending aorta as an inflow source, or other extra-anatomic locations such as the carotid arteries. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Initial approaches to \\u201cpure\\u201d endovascular repair of the aortic arch involved the incorporation of a solitary branch \\u2013 designed initially for the subclavian artery. These involved the placement of a fenestration (reinforced hole), or an actual branch, incorporated into a thoracic endograft. The fenestration or branch would be aligned with the subclavian artery and secured in place with a bridging stent. One of the original series for this approach was reported by Inoue et al. in 1999 (1). They described the placement of a branched aortic endograft within the aortic arch in 15 patients. Fourteen patients had a solitary branch, while 1 had two branches. Their initial technical success (complete exclusion of the aneurysm) was 60%, with 2 patients have access issues and 4 patients having an initial endoleak. In a mean follow up of 12 months, 73% of patients had complete exclusion of their arch aneurysm. Similar approaches have recently been employed by both Medtronic () and Gore () who have launched clinical trials to assess the outcomes of a single branched aortic arch branched endograft. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The incorporation of one branch, however, does not allow for the total endovascular repair of aortic arch pathologies without at least some hybrid approach to preserve flow to the left carotid and subclavian artery systems. To overcome this, and with the evolution of endovascular device designs, several different devices have been described for the complete repair of the aortic arch with fenestrated and branched endografts. One approach has been to apply in situ fenestrations to standard thoracic aortic endografts. This can be accomplished with the use of a retrograde puncture of the endograft with the use of either a stiff wire system or a laser. The fenestration is then reinforced with the placement of a bridging stent. Arch-specific grafts have also been described. The largest series comes from the mid-term results of Next-gen Fenestrated TEVAR trial in Japan (2). The trial employs a customized, precurved, fenestrated endograft (Najuta Stent-graft, Kawasumi Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan), which is comprised of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membrane supported by self-expanding Z-stents. The device has 19 types of curved stent skeleton designs and 8 types of graft fenestrations. The system was used in 393 patients with aortic arch aneurysms at 35 medical centers between 2010 and 2011. Technical success (ability to deliver and deploy the graft) was achieved in 99% of patients, with an initial success without type 1 or 3 endoleaks was achieved in 95% of patients. Thirty-day mortality was only 1.5% and only 1.7% of patients had a neurologic event. Critics of the study, however, that durability of this system has yet to be demonstrated. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The use of a true branched endograft has been described by Haulon et al (3). They describe the outcomes of 38 patients (from 10 centers) that underwent complete arch replacement with a branched aortic endograft. The majority of the grafts had two branches that would allow for the incorporation of the innominate artery and the left carotid artery. Technical success (placement of the endograft with incorporation of the branches and no type 1 or 3 endoleak) was achieved in 84% of the patients. In this high-risk group, 30-day mortality was 13.5% with a similar 13.5% rate of neurologic events. Twenty-nine percent of the patients had evidence of an endoleak on pre-discharge imaging, with 5 proximal type 1 endoleaks, 3 type 2 endoleaks, 1 type 3 endoleak, and 2 of unknown etiology. Two of the endoleaks required an early intervention, and by 6 months of follow up the two indeterminate endoleaks and one of the type 1 endoleaks spontaneously resolved. At a median follow up of 12 months, 9% of the patients required a secondary intervention. In addition, there as a 12% late mortality, none were aortic arch related. The authors were able to demonstrate a significant learning curve with this technology. When compared with the first 10 global cases, the remainder of the cohort had significantly lower intraoperative complications, operative time, fluoroscopy time, endoleak rates and secondary procedure rates. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The evolution of endovascular therapy is significantly changing our approaches to treating aortic disease. This progress is clearly seen even in the complex setting of aortic arch pathology. With improvement of device design, and a growing global experience, improved technical performance and immediate clinical outcomes will continue to improve. Clearly, however, we will need larger volume analysis over a significant period of time to better assess the durability of these devices in the setting of the aortic arch. <\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>References:<\\/h3>\\r\\n<ol><li>\\r\\nInoue K, Hosokawa H, Iwase T, Sato M, Yoshida Y, Ueno K, et al.

The need for data-driven therapeutic strategies is evident, but unlike other areas of vascular medicine and interventional cardiology, few randomized trials exist and future robust trials may be difficult to design and conduct.  Compounding this difficulty is the urgency with which some severe, e.g. \\u201cmassive\\u201d,  PE patients require implementation of definitive therapy.  On the other hand, while initially normotensive PE patients have lower mortality, they may exhibit latent RV dysfunction which may manifest downstream as debilitating pulmonary hypertension;  thus the vascular medicine specialist must make a risk-benefit calculation that includes less well quantifiable parameters such as exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>The concept of a pulmonary embolism response team<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>In assessing the practices of modern PE therapy, comparisons may be drawn to both urgent medical response systems as well as multidisciplinary heart teams.  With regard to the former, rapid response teams have generally been implemented nationwide as a means to quickly mobilize expertise and resources for deteriorating patients.  Examples of this analogy are the protocolized responses for ST segment elevation MI and stroke.  Cardiovascular practitioners are also familiar with multidisciplinary teams for transcatheter aortic valve replacement, which amalgates the experience of cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, interventionalists, echocardiographers and radiologists, and anesthesiologists.  Out of these analogies, and as a response to assessing and reducing variation in care of PE patients, the PERT \\u2013 Pulmonary Embolism Response Team \\u2013 was born and launched October 2012 at <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.massgeneral.org\\/\\\">Massachusetts General Hospital<\\/a> (MGH).  <\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Pulmonary embolism response team: Operational concepts<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>The aim of PERT is to provide an expeditious and coordinated analysis and management opinion on complicated PE cases derived from a multidisciplinary consult so as to optimally use all available therapeutic interventions.  The Massachusetts General Hospital PERT is activated with a single page by a referring clinician, whereupon a vascular medicine fellow evaluates the patient with history, exam, and review of available data including electrocardiogram, CT scan, ultrasonography, and laboratory tests.  Based on PE severity and management questions, a virtual case conference with discussion of clinical data and imaging is convened via <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.gotomeeting.com\\/online\\/\\\">commercial meeting software<\\/a>, with participation by PERT-affiliated vascular medicine and intervention specialists, cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, echocardiographers, radiologists, and hematologists.  The referring physician is included in the online conference, so that recommendations can be immediately conveyed and implemented, especially as regards systemic thrombolytics, catheter-directed thrombolytics and pharmacomechanical strategies, and surgical and mechanical circulatory support options.

Targets that once were sacred to the gold standard of open surgery have been converted to a minimally invasive approach, where the impact on the patient is lessened and the quality of the outcomes preserved.  Many of us, vascular surgeons included, now employ an \\u201cendo first\\u201d approach to peripheral arterial disease, and reserve surgery as a provisional option for prohibitive anatomy and recurrent disease.  That being said, the common femoral artery (CFA) remains a controversial territory, and many still view it as the sole domain of the vascular surgeon.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Historically, common femoral endarterectomy (CFE) has been associated with excellent outcomes.  Surgical series cite a high rate of technical success, good long-term patency, and reasonable return to function for the patient.  It is hard to argue that any therapy other than CFE is appropriate in the \\u201cright patient\\u201d.  Of course the right patient is in the eye of the beholder.  We all recognize that what a patient is offered is very often related to who they present to for an opinion.  Our challenge, regardless of our discipline-orientation, is to truly offer the patient the best option.  <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Current practice has introduced a number of devices that allow for endovascular treatment of CFA disease.  Simple angioplasty with provisional stenting has been reported to have good technical success, reasonable patency, and minimal complications.  Data with more advanced devices and multi-device therapy is lacking, but in individual cases one can achieve sustainable results.  Anti-proliferative balloon therapies (cryoplasty, drug coated balloons) may limit restenosis; atherectomy devices may allow for important debulking; and fracture-free, drug eluting stents or stent grafts may provide durable patency&hellip;time and trials will tell.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>As the portal of flow to the profunda, the true lifeblood of the leg, the CFA needs to be treated with equal attention before and after intervention as well.  VIVA Physicians have initiated an educational module promoting the routine use of ultrasound-guided micro-puncture access for all interventions.  This effort is intended to help endovascular specialists to establish quality initiatives in their home institutions.  The old standard of \\u201cpalpate, poke, and pray\\u201d exposes each of our patients to unnecessary risks.  The ability to truly \\u201csee\\u201d the CFA with ultrasound, to determine the exact location of the profunda bifurcation, and to avoid plaque and calcification ultimately low for much safer access.  Such an approach also benefits our interventional exit strategy as it helps to guide and select methods of vessel closure.  <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Ideally, the approach to the common femoral artery should be an \\u201cours\\u201d approach&hellip;it should be done collaboratively with multi-disciplinary input.  This is especially true when it comes to large-bore access.  Proper consultation between non-surgical interventionalists and cardiac and vascular surgical colleagues is essential for patient safety and outcomes.  Suture-based closure devices have enabled us to percutaneously perform EVAR\\u2019s, TEVAR\\u2019s, and TAVR\\u2019s with a high degree of success.  This approach, however, is far from perfect and failed percutaneous closure is not the time to figure out what your back-up plan is going to be.  Our institution recently instituted a large bore policy to insure that appropriate surgical backup is in place prior to starting any procedure involving a 14F sheath or larger.  Such an approach insures optimal patient safety and stands to further improve our interventional outcomes.<\\/p>\",\"216\":[\"246\"],\"2\":\"\"}}', '2018-02-22 19:50:45', '2018-02-22 19:50:45', '09e5e10c-2a1a-4d4b-8fa1-33540f8e7faf'),

Endovascular therapy is accepted as first line in the majority of cases yet the definitive answer to the most appropriate approach is 5 years away (<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/clinicaltrials.gov\\/show\\/NCT02060630\\\">BEST trial<\\/a>). Till then, aggressive endovascular approach is considered to be justified and procedural choice is currently largely dictated by the clinical presentation, extent of gangrene, diabetes, length of lesion, presence of calcification, need for dialysis, a patient\\u2019s functional status and compliance.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith the recent publication of the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.jvascsurg.org\\/article\\/S0741-5214(13)01515-2\\/pdf\\\">WiFi system that was adopted by the Society for Vascular Surgery<\\/a>, vascular specialist can now be more objective about the chances of limb salvage and realistic about the appropriateness of primary amputation.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Standard antegrade endoluminal and subintimal approach is usually successful in &gt;90% of cases. However, the threshold for resorting to retrograde approach is lower than what it was just 3 years ago. The aim is to restore direct in-line flow for 1-2 tibial arteries for \\u201cbelow the knee\\u201d and \\u201cbelow the ankle\\u201d (BTK and BTA) revascularization. This is not to deny that open bypass with good quality vein is probably the best option for healing a foot wound yet the number of patients who are being offered and are good candidates for bypass is at all times low.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe alternative techniques for lower extremity revascularization is also a moving target. The inventory is at all times high and the skill of the specialists is equally developed. In order to adopt an aggressive approach to tibial runoff, key points need to be addressed.

Also, extensive inventory for crossing CTO, wires, support catheters, low profile balloons, drug-coated balloons and stents.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn summary, being aggressive in regards to salvage of the tibial runoff is dependent on the clinical scenario and should be individualized. The WiFi system is helpful and may find its way into the main stream just like the older TASC classification. While complex endovascular skills are required in most difficult cases, it is also advised to accept modest but clinically useful results.

There have been a number of single center  and multicenter registries  designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of renal artery stent deployment for ARAS.  In a recent meta-analysis of 5 multicenter renal artery stent registries involving over 900 patients, renal artery stent deployment did result in a meaningful reduction in systolic blood pressure .  However, registries do not provide the highest level of evidence required to provide broad recommendations around indications for interventions.  In fact, multisocietal guidelines documents provide relatively little guidance on the indications for renal artery stent deployment in patients with ARAS.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>There have been many attempts at developing non-invasive (renal resistive index at the time of renal artery duplex ultrasonography , brain natriuretic peptide assays ) and invasive (translesional pressure gradients, intravascular ultrasound ,  and fractional flow reserve ) predictors of outcomes before the renal revascularization has been performed.  None of these have gained widespread utility.<br>\\r\\nWithin the past 6 years, three major randomized trials have been published, all suggesting that there is no advantage of stent vs optimal medical therapy in patients with ARAS.  These include the STAR  and ASTRAL  studies, both of which specifically evaluated patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ARAS.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.nejm.org\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1056\\/NEJMoa1310753\\\">CORAL trial<\\/a> was designed to study patients with hypertension or CKD and ARAS, with composite primary cardiovascular and renal endpoints .  In this challenging study with excellent trial oversight, 947 patients with hypertension on at least 2 anti-hypertensive medications or chronic kidney disease were randomized to optimal medical therapy or optimal medical therapy plus stent deployment.  With a primary endpoint evaluating cardiovascular and renal factors (mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, need for dialysis), there was no advantage to stent-based therapy.  Subset analysis did not identify a single group who benefitted from stent-based therapy, including those with global renal ischemia, recurrent \\u201cflash\\u201d pulmonary edema, or those with impaired renal function.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So, is this the end of stenting for ARAS?  Well, if we had another decade and many more millions of dollars for clinical trials, I think not.  Clearly, there are patient subgroups who potentially benefit from this intervention, most notably those who truly fail a reasonable attempt at antihypertensive and lipid lowering therapy.  Those patients were not studied in CORAL.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>However, in this era of affordable care, I suspect that there is little appetite for another prospective multicenter randomized trial of the subsets of patients who really may benefit from this intervention&hellip;.for example, those with very severe ARAS (quantitative angiographic evidence of &gt;80% aorto-ostial lesions) with physiologic evidence of hemodynamic significance (translesional pressure gradients, fractional flow reserve); African Americans with very severe hypertension (fewer than 10% of the entire CORAL cohort were representative of this patient population); and those patients recently committed to hemodialysis for ARAS.<br>\\r\\nWe may be facing severe limitations in reimbursement for patients with ARAS and hypertension, even if they were not sufficiently included in CORAL.  Let this be a lesson to physicians&hellip;.we must be committed to clinical trials studying patients in whom data is lacking.

Recanalization preserves threatened neural tissue improving patient outcome. While recanalization may be spontaneous, this can be more rapidly accomplished with intravenous (IV) and endovascular or intra-arterial stroke therapy (IAT). Recently three well publicized randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate improved outcome with endovascular therapy over IV thrombolytic alone.

These devices are the forefront of new techniques for successful vessel recanalization in acute stroke treatment.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>As endovascular therapists, the four main lessons learnt from these trials are:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol><li>IV therapy is beneficial for proximal large vessel occlusions. Every single eligible stroke patient should receive IV therapy.<\\/li><li>We must improve our patient selection for IAT. The signal of benefit from IAT is clearly smaller than was assumed. We must target proximal large vessel occlusions when there is a large volume of neural tissue at risk.<\\/li><li>We must be faster. Reducing the time from stroke onset to recanalization is key.<\\/li><li>We must recanalize and reperfuse more efficiently. Older generation devices tested in the trials achieved successful recanalization in &lt;50% of cases. We can now achieve unprecedented rates of successful recanalization (up to 90%). However, higher recanalization rates observed with IAT has not translated into proportionally better outcomes. These are where further opportunities lie. We have learnt the distinction between tissue reperfusion and vessel recanalization; a patent proximal vessel without restoration of the parenchymal blush and microvascular circulation is futile.<\\/li><\\/ol>\\r\\n<p>Moreover, in addition to selecting our patients for IAT better, establishing reperfusion as rapidly as possible, by using the best endovascular techniques to achieve the highest reperfusion success, we must also improve our clinical evaluation and assessment of IAT as a therapeutic modality. How do we accomplish all of these?<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Improving patient selection<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Improving patient selection remains an area of controversy. Ultimately, both clinical and imaging selection parameters should be evaluated. Patients with low NIHSS scores are probably unlikely to gain benefit from IAT irrespective of the level of vascular occlusion. Pre-procedural imaging should identify proximal large vessel occlusions, and assess the extent of established tissue injury. Clinical outcomes is strongly tied to final infarct volume &mdash; good clinical outcome is unlikely for patients with &gt;70cc infarct volume, with reperfusion of infarcts &gt;100cc likely to cause harm. These relevant threshold volumes may be much smaller for elderly patients. MRI DWI remains the gold standard for assessment of core volume; CT techniques are also widely used.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Improving treatment times<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Improving treatment times requires initial stroke treatment process mapping. Measuring your clinical practice process and time metrics is a revealing exercise. Delivery of IV tPA is guided by the Golden Hour. For IAT the expectations are less clear. Comprehensive Stroke Center certification requires a generous door to IAT time of 2 hours or less, but despite this many stroke centers struggle to treat patients within this time frame. Rethinking our approach to logistics for these patients will deliver great time savings. One measure with particularly high impact is parallel workflow streams for the individual role groups involved in delivering acute ischemic stroke care. Rather than working sequentially, we can generate time savings by working concurrently. Sustained success requires a committed, multidisciplinary team.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Improving endovascular techniques<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Improving endovascular techniques is a broader concept than simply using devices that reperfuse more efficiently. The field is moving toward conscious sedation instead of general anesthesia, following recent data that suggests better outcomes. Alternate techniques, such as direct aspiration using large bore intracranial catheters and the new stentreiver devices are data driven approaches to recanalization and should be universally used. Finally, the access systems used to deliver these devices to the clot face will be improved, and will allow faster groin access to reperfusion times.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Improving studies<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Improving studies that evaluate IAT is the final component. We advocate better means of assessing outcomes, standardizing approaches to treatment across institutions (to allow easier and more informed comparisons) and the validation of biomarkers (e.g. time to reperfusion or final infarct volume). The recent randomized trials have produced the positive effect of galvanizing the endovascular community towards generating evidence, and have enhanced cooperation across the field as a result. We should be maximizing the effect of this.<br>\\r\\nApproaching IAT in this multifaceted and comprehensive way will achieve that ultimate of goals, improving our patients\\u2019 outcomes for severe acute ischemic stroke. IAT is a specific and potent therapy for a selected subset of patients. Applied correctly, it has a power that is almost resurrective. We are excited by the progress of the field and look forward to this next chapter of care for our stroke patients.<\\/p>\",\"216\":[\"254\"],\"2\":\"\"}}', '2018-02-22 19:53:53', '2018-02-22 19:53:53', '0660f62c-6745-4a4a-9b90-7e095995e7e0'),

In that time, there has been a steady rollout<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>of devices, each equipped with a sexy new moniker.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Atherectomy: Exploring the Evidence<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Despite much investment and marketing by a handful of manufacturers, atherectomy has yet to find an evidence-based niche. Though widely accepted for<br>\\r\\ndebulking of calcified lesions to allow full stent expansion, there is considerable debate over the long term patency afforded by a strategy of standalone<br>\\r\\natherectomy. Promising competing technologies, such as fracture resistant stents and drug-eluting balloons, have stolen much of the limelight. This is<br>\\r\\ndespite the built-in appeal of performing a procedure where the atheroma is actually removed from the patient, as opposed to pancaked to the vessel\\u2019s<br>\\r\\nintimal surface.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Economic factors may also drive atherectomy use, with reimbursement being substantially higher for femoropopliteal atherectomy ($632.49) than stenting<br>\\r\\n($518.17), per facility prices on <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.cms.gov\\/\\\">www.cms.gov<\\/a> (accessed July 12, 2013). Though personnel and equipment costs are higher<br>\\r\\nwith atherectomy than stenting, there is still an institutional financial incentive that cannot be ignored (http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/18296016).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Atherectomy lends itself particularly well to common femoral, ostial superficial femoral and popliteal artery intervention, where stenting is unattractive,<br>\\r\\nespecially in patients that are high risk for endarterectomy. Investigations of the use of atherectomy in conjunction with drug-eluting balloons for<br>\\r\\nlesions across joints are currently underway (<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/23147770\\\">http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/23147770<\\/a>).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>What, then, could explain the hesitancy to adopt a role for atherectomy? Compared with angioplasty and stenting, atherectomies are longer, more costly and<br>\\r\\nlabor intensive. Given the greater number of moving parts (specialized guidewires, embolic protection etc) involved in the procedure, demonstrating<br>\\r\\nequivalence of atherectomy to angioplasty or stenting may not be sufficient to justify use. Though there are numerous single center registries reporting<br>\\r\\nlimb salvage rates with atherectomy alone comparable to angioplasty or stenting (75-90%), only three randomized trials have been published:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Shammas <em>et al <\\/em>(2011) compared a strategy of directional atherectomy with adjunctive angioplasty to angioplasty alone in infrainguinal disease ( <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/21757372\\\">http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/21757372<\\/a>). At one year, there was no difference in target<br>\\r\\nlesion revascularization, though atherectomy reduced the need for bailout stenting.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The CALCIUM 360 pilot trial (2012) compared orbital atherectomy plus angioplasty to angioplasty alone in patients with critical limb ischemia ( <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/22891826\\\">http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/22891826<\\/a>). Atherectomy was associated with greater procedural<br>\\r\\nsuccess, less stent utilization and lower target vessel revascularization, though p-values did not reach statistical significance.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Twelve month results of COMPLIANCE 360 show similar rates of target revascularization (and again, lower stent use) with balloon only versus orbital<br>\\r\\natherectomy in the femoropopliteal segment ( <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/content.onlinejacc.org\\/article.aspx?articleid=1206286\\\">http:\\/\\/content.onlinejacc.org\\/article.aspx?articleid=1206286<\\/a>).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>These trials have been criticized for qualifying the use of stents as a treatment failure. A stent-avoidant strategy has never been shown to result in<br>\\r\\nfavorable outcomes. In fact, drug-eluting stents may end up as the gold standard for endovascular therapy in the superficial femoral artery. The questions<br>\\r\\nthat need to be addressed in future trials are whether atherectomy with provisional stent placement beats a stenting only strategy and which debulking<br>\\r\\ndevice yields the best long term patency.

Recently featured<br>\\r\\nin the DEFINITIVE LE registry presented by Lawrence Garcia at the VIVA conference in 2012, a multicenter study of 800 subjects with claudication or<br>\\r\\ncritical limb ischemia, TurboHawk atherectomy was established as a safe, effective therapy with one-year patency rates comparable to drug-eluting stents<br>\\r\\nand balloons (75.4% for SFA, 77.1% for popliteal and 89.6% for infra-popliteal, with lesion lengths of 8.1 cm, 6 cm and 5.5 cm, respectively) (<br>\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.turbohawkdevice.com\\/content\\/downloads\\/def_le_12_mo_viva_garcia_28sep12.pdf\\\"><br>\\r\\nhttp:\\/\\/www.turbohawkdevice.com\\/content\\/downloads\\/DEF_LE_12_Mo_VIVA_Garcia_28SEP12.pdf<br>\\r\\n<\\/a><br>\\r\\n).

Registry data is relatively scant compared to other modalities. However, results of the<br>\\r\\nEXCITE ISR trial, designed to show a potential novel role for laser in treatment of restenosis, are eagerly anticipated (<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.spectranetics.com\\/patients\\/pad-peripheral-artery-disease\\/clinical-trial-enrollment\\\">http:\\/\\/www.spectranetics.com\\/patients\\/pad-peripheral-artery-disease\\/clinical-trial-enrollment<\\/a>).

Many labs keep an atherectomy device on the shelf for tackling lesions that are not dilatable, and it can be an elegant solution when seeking to avoid stent placement in the common femoral or popliteal arteries. Importantly, endovascular atherectomy has not been compared to open endarterectomy in these vessels (CFA, popliteal artery). Registry studies have established the safety and efficacy of atherectomy, but carefully constructed trials will be needed to elucidate where these devices stand amongst the other new players vying for a spot in the peripheral interventionalist\\u2019s armamentarium.<\\/p>\",\"216\":[\"256\"],\"2\":\"\"}}', '2018-02-22 20:27:47', '2018-02-22 20:27:47', 'c68c90c8-7dfe-437d-b25e-3b03ff1b3b42'),

I have used all of the current modular devices (Cook , Medtronic, and Gore) and unibody devices, they all work very well. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>Do you preferentially use any of them?<\\/b><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s2\\\">Dr. Bacharach<\\/span><span class=\\\"s1\\\">: My father drove a Ford. He liked Fords. Our neighbor liked Chevrolets. I can\\u2019t tell you that any of them shines above and beyond. There are some nuance differences, such as supra-renal fixation, which the Cook and Medtronic devices have and the Gore device does not. I don\\u2019t really see that as a drawback.<span class=\\\"Apple-converted-space\\\">&nbsp; <\\/span>We currently do about 80% of our volume with the Gore device. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>What about newer devices such as AFX Endovascular AAA system\\u00ae (Endologix, Irvine California) and Ovation\\u00ae (Trivascular, Santa Rosa, California) device? <\\/b><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s2\\\">Dr. Bacharach<\\/span><span class=\\\"s1\\\">: The AFX Endovascular AAA system\\u00ae (Endologix, Irvine California) is a useful unibody device. When we employ snorkeling techniques to salvage the internal iliac arteries, we will often use this. Gore has some new branch preserving devices that we are currently involved with in trials. Ovation Prime&trade; (Trivascular, Santa Rosa, California) is interesting. We don\\u2019t use it in the acute setting (rupture) but for short necks and other scenarios it is appealing. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>Do the caliber of the devices affect how you think about them and use them? <\\/b><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s2\\\">Dr. Bacharach<\\/span><span class=\\\"s1\\\">: Both the AFx&trade; Endovascular system and Ovation Prime&trade; are smaller and lend themselves to percutaneous strategies. However, I have used preclose technique for all of my endografts. Whether I go percutaneous is dictated more by common femoral artery anatomy. If you are careful and use good technique you can use percutaneous techniques with all of them. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>Moving on to lower extremity interventions, give us some insight into how you approach femoropopliteal occlusive disease? <\\/b><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s2\\\">Dr. Bacharach<\\/span><span class=\\\"s1\\\">: If I can access antegrade I will. I use a 6 French sheath and either an angled glidewire or an Terumo Advantage&trade; (Terumo\\u00ae Medical Corporation). If I have gone extraluminal, I will reenter with 0.014 CTO wires or a V18. I am \\u201cold-school\\u201d and really never use crossing devices. Perhaps this is because I am cost-conscious. I very rarely require a reentry tool, but I use the Outback when necessary. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>Do you believe in atherectomy? <\\/b><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s2\\\">Dr. Bacharach<\\/span><span class=\\\"s1\\\">: Not really. I think of it like a niche device. I found that with atherectomy I was getting similar restenosis as I did with stenting, but I could place a stent in a fraction of the time. So, I rarely use atherectomy devices. I reserve its use for specific anatomical locations. Isolated short popliteal artery segments that I am trying to avoid stenting, or ostial profunda lesions in a patient with prior common femoral endarterectomy and profundaplasty. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>Would you describe yourself and a stenter or stent-minimizer? <\\/b><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s2\\\">Dr. Bacharach:<\\/span><span class=\\\"s1\\\"> I am a stenter. I am trying to get the best luminal result that I can at the initial presentation. I balloon and stent. I do not want to come back. We used to see short-segment SFA stenoses that responded well to balloon angioplasty, but I just don\\u2019t see those anymore. That\\u2019s not the patient population that I treat. The pattern of disease seems to have changed. I find myself looking after a sicker and older patient population with multi-level more extensive disease. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>When you stent, what do you like to use?<\\/b><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s2\\\">Dr. Bacharach<\\/span><span class=\\\"s1\\\">: For routine superficial femoral arteries arteries and longer lesions I have gone with mostly Medtronic nitinol self-expanding stents. In terms of DES, I tend to use Zilver\\u00ae PTX\\u00ae (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana) in restenosis after seeing some of Zeller\\u2019s work. I rarely use Zilver PTX\\u00ae as a first stent. There are a few other intriguing stents on the market. The SMART\\u00ae stent (Cordis, Bridgewater, NJ) is interesting and easy to deploy. I am still waiting to see how they fare in the long-term. The Supera\\u00ae (Abbot Vascular, Abbott Park, Ilinois) stent, which I have been deploying for a few years now, is very useful, though there is a bit of a learning curve with the device. There is a role for it when going across the adductor canal especially when I need to stent the above-knee popliteal artery, though I try to avoid the popliteal when at all possible. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>Do you enjoy critical limb ischemia?<\\/b><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s2\\\">Dr. Bacharach<\\/span><span class=\\\"s1\\\">: Not really. I think of critical limb ischemia something I have to do part and parcel with providing a full service to patients. Patients with critical limb are challenging patients with a high recurrence rate and are often recalcitrant to medical therapy and risk factor modification. Overall, I find critical limb to be professionally less satisfying than other areas of vascular intervention. I don\\u2019t shy away from it, but I don\\u2019t relish it either. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>Do you use pedal access? When? <\\/b><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s2\\\">Dr. Bacharach:<\\/span><span class=\\\"s1\\\"> Not frequently. It is rare that I am not successful in an antegrade fashion. However, desperate measures must be taken by desperate men. In general, I am very conservative about pedal access. I will only access the pedals after an antegrade attempt has failed once or twice. Maybe this happens a handful of times a year. We used to do popliteal access, but I have largely abandoned that because sheath management can be such a problem. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>I have heard that you perform catheter directed lysis, do you think the type of catheter matters?<br>\\r\\n<\\/b><\\/span><span class=\\\"s2\\\">Dr. Bacharach<\\/span><span class=\\\"s1\\\">: No, I don\\u2019t. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>What do you think CREST II will demonstrate?<\\/b><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s3\\\">Dr. Bacharach:<\\/span><span class=\\\"s4\\\"> CREST II <\\/span><span class=\\\"s1\\\">will be difficult to recruit for.

However, it will be dependent on centers in which both surgical and endovascular skill are equivalent. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>What made you successful and good at what you do? <\\/b><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s2\\\">Dr. Bacharach<\\/span><span class=\\\"s1\\\">: I was fortunate to have had wonderful training at the Mayo and at Cleveland. I worked hard. I was available. And I was always very passionate about what I was doing. Large volume was very helpful. It is like that old joke, \\u201chow do you get good judgment? Through experience. How do you get experience? By having bad judgment\\u201d. I made a lot of sacrifices. I missed lots of soccer games. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>What advice would you give to clinicians applying for positions in the field of vascular intervention? <\\/b><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s2\\\">Dr. Bacharach:<\\/span><span class=\\\"s1\\\"> Many fellows are graduating with a wealth of experiences in their respective training programs. But one has to realize that your training is never truly complete and that you are always evolving. Having the mindset that you are willing to ask for help is important. Coachability is key. We are wary of applicants who are truly overconfident and come out pounding on their chest saying \\u201cI want to do complex cases\\u201d. That is a red flag for us. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>Looking at the future of vascular intervention, do you think the future is bleak or bright? <\\/b><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s2\\\">Dr. Bacharach: <\\/span><span class=\\\"s1\\\"> It depends on your mindset. I think that it is bright for practitioners who are dedicated to vascular intervention and have demonstrated true interest and\\/or expertise. One has to be willing to see the swollen legs, the blue digits, and the odd vasculitidies. The future might be bleaker for people\\/coronary interventionalists who are solely interested in expanding their interventional volumes. High-volume centers don\\u2019t really want people who dabble in vascular intervention. One has to embrace vascular medicine in a more holistic way. You have to carve out an area of expertise and be recognized by your referring practitioners as someone who takes care of people beyond the bread and butter of cardiovascular medicine. With the right mindset, the future is very bright. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">This field is constantly changing and fascinating. The level of change in vascular intervention has been monumental and has outpaced the advancements within coronary intervention over the past decade. There will be challenges, especially cost. We have demonstrated that we can look after patients well but expensively. Can we do it cost-effectively? That will be a huge challenge for the interventionalists of the future. Overall, I am high on the future of vascular intervention.<\\/span><\\/p>\",\"216\":[\"258\"],\"2\":\"\"}}', '2018-02-22 20:28:34', '2018-02-22 20:28:34', '7f9a5bb7-2f3b-4a79-9ad1-a6045f8f96fd'),

The mainstay of chronic therapy&mdash; anticoagulation&mdash;prevents clot propagation and recurrent thrombosis but offers little acute relief to patients with painful DVT and has low success rates in forestalling post-phlebitic syndrome. The alternative, thrombolysis, carries its own risks, including major bleeding and increased initial costs, but may be an important option in select patients and offer downstream economic benefits.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>Post-phlebitic syndrome<\\/b><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Post-phlebitic (post-thrombotic; PPS) syndrome affects up to 20-50% of patients within two years after a DVT, despite adequate medical therapy (1). Patients experience lifestyle-limiting pain, edema, venous ectasia, hyperpigmentation, and venous ulceration; severity is typically assessed using the Villalta score, which tallies 5 symptoms and 7 clinical signs into a cumulative point total (with &gt;15 points being severe). <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Patients at highest risk include those presenting with initial symptoms, iliofemoral DVT, female gender, advanced age, obesity, and a history of prior DVT. Importantly patients with iliofemoral DVT who are treated with anticoagulation alone have a 2.4-fold increased recurrence rate compared with femoropopliteal DVT patients. (2) Exercise training, elastic compression stockings, and intermittent pneumatic compression have a limited role in preventing and treating PPS and cannot be used in the presence of ulceration.

Options include operative thrombectomy or catheter-directed thrombolysis, either of which may be coupled with treatment of associated vascular stenosis or insufficiency with stenting or bypass. Catheter directed infusion improves drug delivery directly within the thrombus, and may be done with or without mechanical thrombectomy utilizing high-powered irrigation \\/ rheolysis (e.g., AngioJet<b>&copy;<\\/b>, MEDRAD, PA, USA), catheter osscilation \\/ rotation (e.g., Trellis, Covidien, MA, USA), or ultrasound enhancement (e.g., EKOS, EKOS Corporation, WA, USA).<\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) has been employed for over a decade but suffers from a paucity of robust, prospective data. Retrospective and small prospective studies have shown improved quality of life measures, reduction in residual thrombus, and that elimination of thrombus correlates with positive questionnaire results. (4,5,6) The addition of mechanical thrombectomy to CDT shortens hospital stays and decreases lytic doses compared to catheter-directed lysis alone. (7) A large retrospective study of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database reviewing over 3649 cases of CDT found no improvement in in-hospital mortality, but an increase in cost ($80,094 vs. $28, 164; p&lt;0.001), blood transfusion (11.1% vs. 6.5%; p&lt;0.001), and intracranial hemorrhage (0.9% vs. 0.3%; p&lt;0.03) associated with CDT compared with propensity-matched patients with proximal DVT who were treated with anticoagulation alone.

(2) In addition, the 2009 Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus Document on Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC-II), similar to the 2005 ACCF\\/AHA guidelines, had advised screening all patients &gt;70 years regardless of comorbidities and all patients &gt;50 years of age with at least one risk factor. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Why the disagreement, especially over a test that has long been praised for its low cost and rapid point-of-care administration?<\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>Epidemiologic Studies<\\/b><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Each committee highlighted different sources of evidence to justify their recommendations. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">The 2011 ACCF\\/AHA guidelines updated their screening recommendations because of a single, large observational study: the German Epidemiologic Trial on Ankle Brachial Index Study Group. (3) This study enrolled 6880 unselected adults &gt;65 years of age in Germany, all of whom were interviewed to assess for vascular disease and underwent resting ABI with a cutoff of &lt;0.90. Patients were classified as having peripheral arterial disease (PAD) if they were asymptomatic with an abnormal ABI or symptomatic with a history of intervention or amputation. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">With this case definition, the study found that 21% of adults over the age of 65 had some form of PAD. Of those, 12.3% were asymptomatic, and 8.7% symptomatic. About a quarter of the symptomatic patients had undergone any intervention. And symptomatic patients had a higher risk of vascular events, but not overall mortality, compared with asymptomatic patient. But, over 5 years of follow-up, asymptomatic patients with PAD had a higher overall mortality than patients without PAD (19.5 vs. 41.7 patients per 1000 patient-years; HR 1.66; 95% CI 1.38-2.00), a finding echoed in prior studies. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Though this study was available to them at the time of writing, the USPTF did not reference the German Epidemiologic Trial. Instead, the committee referenced the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which showed that only 5.9% of patients &gt;40 years of age or 17.5% of patients over 75 had PAD, as defined solely by a low ABI (&lt;0.90), a less sensitive case definition.

(5) USPTF primarily cites the Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis trial, which randomized 4941 asymptomatic patients with ABI &lt;0.95 to aspirin or placebo and found no significant benefit in cardiovascular outcomes (myocardial infarction, stroke, or revascularization). (6) <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">On the other hand, the ACCF\\/AHA guidelines recommended aggressive risk factor modification, enhanced patient follow-up, and pharmacological therapy, with emphasis on statin (IB) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) (IIB) treatment. The Heart Protection Study included 6748 patients with PAD who did not have coronary disease; those randomized to 40mg of simvastatin benefited from a significant 25% reduction in vascular events compared with placebo. (7) Based on this and other trials showing a comparable reduction in CV events, the new 2013 ACC\\/AHA cholesterol guidelines also recommended high-intensity statin therapy in any patient with PAD.

Its diagnosis alters a patient\\u2019s risk profile and will cause clinicians to follow patients more closely and have a heightened sensitivity to associated conditions, especially concomitant coronary disease, which is present in &gt;60% of patients with PAD. (9) The diagnosis also helps the clinician emphasize important risk factor modification efforts, such as tobacco cessation, weight loss, exercise, and cholesterol management. Its presence may be the sole impetus to start a statin. In addition, distinguishing between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients can be challenging, particularly in patients who do not exercise enough to produce symptoms. (9) And thus screening elderly patients with a baseline risk of around 20% will likely identify both those patients who are truly asymptomatic as well as those who did not know they were symptomatic until they were actually tested. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>Take home message<\\/b>: asymptomatic adults &gt;65 years of age regardless of risk factors or &gt;50 years of age with risk factors should be screened with a simple, office-based ankle-brachial index study<\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>References<\\/b><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">(1) Moyer VA; U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

PAD is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis. The three cardinal manifestations of atherosclerosis are coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease<span class=\\\"Apple-converted-space\\\">&nbsp; <\\/span>and PAD. Once a patient is diagnosed with PAD, they are at higher risk of suffering future MI, stroke or death. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">PAD affects 8-12 million Americans, second only to coronary artery disease. The prevalence of PAD increases with age. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or NHANES, found the prevalence of PAD among patients age 40 years or older in the United States was 4.3%; for patients age 70 or older, the prevalence of PAD was 14.5%. The PAD Awareness, Risk, and Treatment: New Resources for Survival Program, or PARTNERS program, included patients either more than 70 years old or between 50 to 69 years old and with diabetes or a history of smoking. When common risk factors were included in the population, the prevalence of PAD was approximately 29%, or 1\\/3 of all patients. Smoking, diabetes, HTN and elevated cholesterol are the strongest risk factors for developing PAD.<\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Gender Differences in Prevalence of PAD<\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">According to one series of 6880 pts from 344 primary practices in Germany from 2004, the prevalence of PAD in females was greater than men in those &gt;85 yrs of age (6). However, according to pooled data from 6 registries (over 24,000 pts), PAD prevalence was slightly higher in men within all age groups. Unfortunately, published series are often marred by selection bias and many feel that the true burden of PAD (defined by ABI &lt; 0.9 obtained from U.S. Census 2010 data) may be the most reliable indicator of disease prevalence in the U.S. In a study adopted by Hirsch et al., the burden of PAD was higher in women over the age of 70 as compared to men. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Unfortunately, the diagnosis of PAD represents the tip of the iceberg. PAD is a marker of systemic atherosclerosis, a major predictor of future MI, CVA and death. Unfortunately, few studies have reviewed potential gender-specific mortality differences in PAD. In one study adapted from data collected by the ABI Collaboration study (480, 325 person years: 24, 955 men and 23,339 women), overall rates of CVD and mortality were similar in men and women, however both major CV events and mortality<span class=\\\"Apple-converted-space\\\">&nbsp; <\\/span>were significantly<span class=\\\"Apple-converted-space\\\">&nbsp; <\\/span>increased in women as compared to men with more advanced disease (ABI &lt; 0.7 or &gt; 1.4). <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Due to the limited data and awareness of PAD in women, the American Heart Association, in collaboration with the Vascular Disease Foundation (and its \\u201cPeripheral Arterial Disease Coalition\\u201d), commissioned the AHA\\/PAD coalition to urge healthcare professionals to promptly establish PAD in women \\u2018at risk\\u2019 and to incorporate PAD-specific risk messages within current women\\u2019s health clinics in an effort to raise community awareness. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><b>Summary Points:<\\/b><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Gender and age-specific prevalence of PAD has not been clearly defined from published population based studies. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Although the age-dependent prevalence of PAD in adult women may be lower than men, <b>the total population burden of PAD appears to be higher in women<\\/b>, particularly in those over age of 70. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">All pts with <b>PAD are more likely to die<\\/b> from CHD events than those without PAD. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">There is a <b>Trend towards higher CV mortality, all-cause mortality and major CV event rates in women<\\/b> with abnormal ABI (&lt; 0.7, &gt; 1.4). <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">References:<\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">1.

However, studies have shown that most patients with PAD are asymptomatic (50%), or present with atypical symptoms (33%). In fact, asymptomatic PAD is very common in women. According to the Women\\u2019s Health and Aging Study (WHAS), 63% of those over the age of 65 with ABI &lt; 0.9 had noexertional leg symptoms. In the Walking and Leg Circulation Study (WALCS), a cohort of 460 PAD participants in the Chicago area, women were more than 2X\\u2019s more likely to report the presence of atypical exertional leg symptoms that sometimes began at rest. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Therefore, the vast majority of patients with PAD may be missed based on history and physical alone, highlighting the importance of further screening for PAD (i.e. use of ABI\\u2019s) in high risk populations- and in particular women. In fact, the updated ACC\\/AHA guidelines in 2011 suggest obtaining ABI\\u2019s in at risk populations defined by those who are 70 years and older, or who are 50 years and older with a history of smoking or diabetes (Level of Evidence 1B). <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Currently, there are no known gender-based differences in the diagnostic sensitvity or accuracy of the physiologic or classic image-based diagnostic PAD tests.<span class=\\\"Apple-converted-space\\\">&nbsp; <\\/span>Arterial diameters in women are smaller than age matched diameters in men, and it is unclear if these anatomic differences may have some effect on gender-specific treatment outcomes. <\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">PAD Treatment in Women<\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\\\"s1\\\">The goals of PAD treatment are two-fold: to improve the affected limb (in presence of debilitating symptoms of critical limb ischemia) and to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with PAD.

It should be noted, however, that if a patient is post-procedure and unstable the right place to go is back to the cath lab, and not to the CT suite. Going to the CT suite may result in loss of precious time. Once the presence of hematoma is confirmed by CT, the patient should be taken immediately to the endovascular suite for localization and treatment of the source of bleeding (as in the clinical vignette). Alternatively, any patient showing signs of a retroperitoneal hematoma while still on the cath table should undergo femoral angiography at the access sitePerforations can be managed with close observation (as in Appendix \\u2013 Clinical Vignette) or immediate contralateral access and intervention.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Endovascular Therapy for a retroperitoneal hemorrhage<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Options for endovascular repair are covered stent (for iliac or femoral arteries) or coil embolization (for small vessel perforations). In emergencies, it is best to use whichever of these techniques is most readily available and familiar. Important considerations for stent graft placement include oversizing by 1-2 mm to ensure sealing, avoiding the common femoral bifurcation and preparing for balloon occlusion in the common iliac if difficulties are encountered, leading to a prolonged procedure in a rapidly decompensating patient. When embolization is chosen, coils should be deployed on both sides of a perforation to prevent re-bleeding from dissection propagation or distal retrograde flow via abdominal collaterals.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>When is surgery needed for the treatment of a retroperitoneal hemorrhage<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Surgery may be necessary in cases where endovascular therapy fails and bleeding continues despite intervention. In these cases, direct visualization and ligation of the bleeding artery may be necessary, with abdominal packing to prevent ongoing hemorrhage. Abdominal compartment syndrome can develop as the result of a large hematoma. Early surgery (i.e. before trial of conservative treatment, followed by angiography and intervention if necessary) is frowned upon, as removing a retroperitoneal hematoma may relieve tamponade and exacerbate bleeding. It may also be difficult to localize the source of bleeding in the operating room, whereas in the angiography (or hybrid) suite a perforation may be more readily visualized.<\\/p>\",\"216\":[\"270\"],\"2\":\"\"}}', '2018-02-22 20:33:15', '2018-02-22 20:33:15', '645d5f5b-4410-4525-91a1-3f2f58bff777'),

Systemic thrombolysis is also effective for those pulmonary embolism patients with shock, but it comes at a cost of increased bleeding ( http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/15262836). There is less certainty regarding the optimal treatment for patients with submassive pulmonary embolism, defined as the subset of patients that are hemodynamically stable with evidence of right heart strain. Several trials seeking to add clarity for this \\u201cgray zone\\u201d have been recently published.<br>\\r\\nClinical Vignette<br>\\r\\nA 47 year-old male with no medical history presented with dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain to a local ER.

The primary endpoint, death or hemodynamic collapse at 7 days, was significantly reduced in the tenecteplase group (2.6% vs. 5.6%, P=0.02). This benefit was driven by a reduction in hemodynamic collapse but not mortality, and bleeding risk was higher in the tenecteplase group including intracranial hemorrhage (hemorrhagic strokes- 10 vs. 1). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that patients TOPCOAT (http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/24484241) randomized patients to anticoagulation versus anticoagulation plus tenecteplase. The primary endpoint was a composite of: in-hospital death, clinical deterioration, or bleeding or poor quality-of-life, reduced functional capacity, or recurrent pulmonary embolism at 90 days. The primary endpoint was significantly reduced in the tenecteplase group (15% vs. 37%, P=0.02), with the bulk of the benefit being driven by improvements in functional capacity or health perception of patients. This trial was terminated prematurely due to funding issues after randomizing approximately half of the intended sample size.<br>\\r\\nMOPETT (http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/23102885) was a unique trial that examined \\u201csafe dose\\u201d thrombolysis for patients with non-massive pulmonary embolism. Not all of the patients included had submassive pulmonary embolism (eg approximately 2\\/3 had elevated cardiac markers). Patients were randomized to anticoagulation versus anticoagulation plus safe dose thrombolysis, defined as 50 mg of TPA for patients &gt;50 kg and 0.5 mg\\/kg for patients Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis<br>\\r\\nHigher rates of bleeding have been reported with systemic thrombolysis in large pulmonary embolism trials. Catheter-directed thrombolysis may be theoretically advantageous since much lower doses of thrombolytics may be administered to achieve the same therapeutic effect, and catheter-directed delivery may allow for higher concentrations of drug to associate with thrombus leading to faster clot dissolution.<br>\\r\\nULTIMA (http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/24226805) randomized patients with submassive pulmonary embolism to anticoagulation versus anticoagulation plus catheter-directed thrombolysis. The primary endpoint was the change in right ventricle to left ventricle ratio (marker of right heart strain) at 24 hours following initiation of therapy. Catheter-directed thrombolysis was effective in reducing the primary endpoint, but clinical outcomes including mortality and recurrent venous thromboembolism were similar at 90 days. Bleeding was non-significantly higher in the catheter-directed thrombolysis group.<br>\\r\\nSEATTLE II was a single arm prospective trial of ultrasound assisted lysis for submassive pulmonary embolism (Piazza G. A Prospective, single-arm, multicenter trial of ultrasound-facilitated, low-dose fibrinolysis for acute massive and submassive pulmonary embolism (SEATTLE II). Program and abstracts of the American College of Cardiology Scientific Session; March 29-31, 2014; Washington, DC. Late-breaking clinical trial). The preliminary presented results of this study showed a similar safety profile as the ULTIMA study had, and again similar efficacy as far as surrogates to patient status including right ventricular size and pulmonary arterial pressure improvement.<br>\\r\\nSeveral recent meta-analyses including one published in JAMA by a group led by Dr. Jay Giri (http:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pubmed\\/24938564) included many of the aforementioned studies and came to the conclusion that thrombolysis resulted in improved patient outcome after submassive PE, however at the price of increased risk of major bleeding. Two main limitations of these analyses were that they mixed systemic and catheter directed data and that net-clinical benefit was highly dependent on the weight placed on intracranial hemorrhage.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Case Vignette Revisited<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Of the choices listed, answer #4 is correct. PEITHO demonstrated a reduced risk or death or hemodymamic collapse at 7 days with use of systemic thrombolysis for intermediate-risk PE. MOPETT demonstrated improved quality-of-life measures for patients treated with \\u201csafe dose\\u201d thrombolytics.ULTIMA demonstrated that catheter-directed thrombolysis improves right ventricular function, as assessed by a surrogate marker of right heart strain (RV\\/LV ratio). The literature to date has yet to demonstrate reductions in hard cardiovascular enpoints including mortality or recurrent venous thromboembolism, though such data may be forthcoming through additional trials or longer term follow up of those already published. Pending the arrival of such data, the decision to use catheter-directed thrombolysis should be individualized, with an open acknowledgment of the current evidence gaps.<\\/p>\",\"216\":[\"272\"],\"2\":\"\"}}', '2018-02-22 20:34:14', '2018-02-22 20:34:14', 'b08c1ba2-8b2e-461f-b9c6-93f04affd6db'),

The patient was an avid athlete who performed vigorous upper body exercised on a regular basis. Initial work up including upper extremity ultrasound confirmed right subclavian vein DVT (figure 1). She had no personal or family history of thrombophilia, and screening blood work was unremarkable. Chest X ray (figure 2) did not show evidence of a cervical rib. Based on her presentation a discussion ensued with her physicians as to the best management. Ultimately, given the time frame of the thrombus, of which the acute episode appeared to be only several days time, angiography with possible catheter direct thrombolysis (CDT) was offered to the patient.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Angiography noted both acute and chronic features: it confirmed 100% thrombotic occlusion of the subclavian vein at the level of the first rib (figure 3). Additionally there appeared to be collateralization, which had formed allowing for drainage into the SVC. However, given the acute presentation and progressive, significant symptoms, further intervention was attempted.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The lesion was crossed easily with an 0.035 stiff angled glide wire, and an EKOS catheter (Ekosonic Endovascular) was placed uneventfully with tPA infusing at 1mg\\/hr overnight (figure 4). This catheter combines a traditional lytic catheter with side holes, with a tiny ultrasound filament, which is postulated to assist in clot fragmentation. The patient was also treated with adjunctive aspirin and heparin.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Repeat angiography 24 hours later revealed some recanalization of the vessel and was treated with adjunctive Angiojet therapy (Medrad) and subsequent balloon angioplasty with a 9.40mm Foxcross balloon (Abbott Vascular). Final angiography revealed the vessel to be fully recanalized (Figures 5-7). The patient was then referred on to Vascular surgery for consideration of rib resection in the setting of this current event.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Approach to patients with effort thrombosis:<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>The issue of \\u201ceffort thrombosis\\u201d arises from an anatomical abnormality of the thoracic outlet that predisposes patients to compression of the axillary and subclavian venous system. This syndromes goes by various names including: venous thoracic outlet syndrome, Paget-Schroetter syndrome, \\u201cspontaneous\\u201d thrombosis of the upper extremity, or effort thrombosis.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Congenital features such as cervical rib, extra muscle, or abnormalities of tendon insertion may cause it. Secondary causes can include a fracture at the site, or muscle hypertrophy from repetitive exercise (ie. rowing, weight lifting, pitching). Additionally, extremes of motion, or repetitive motion alone can create a nidus for this condition. Given this, the presentation is most commonly seen in young, athletic patients.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Physical exam will be remarkable for swelling of the affected extremity, however, based on the chronicity of the process, one may appreciate the formation of venous collaterals on the upper chest of the affected side (Urschel\\u2019s sign). Depending on the severity of compression, features of brachial plexus compression may also be present. Evaluation and examination should include careful assessment for the possibility of pulmonary embolism progressing from this condition.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>As mentioned in the above vignette, imaging is essential to the diagnosis of this condition.<br>\\r\\nCXR is helpful to rule out obvious anatomic causes however, sometimes until the patient undergoes surgical exploration, the immediate anatomic cause is not readily apparent. Vascular ultrasound is extremely helpful in solidifying this diagnosis, with angiography still as the gold standard for assessment.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If no apparent anatomic cause is found then consideration of screening for thrombophilia or malignancy is warranted.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>A departure from the guidelines?<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Given that this is a less common presentation of DVT, there have been no randomized trials evaluating different treatment algorithms for this disorder, leading much of the management to case reports and expert opinion (1).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Given the lack of high quality evidence based trials in this area, the most recent ACP Chest guidelines still place anticoagulation alone as the strongest recommendation (2). However, combining expert consensus, case reports, and the most current ACP guidelines, several hallmarks of treatment have been forwarded:<br>\\r\\nRegardless of cause, a minimum of 3 months of anticoagulation should be considered<br>\\r\\nArm compression with an arm sleeve and elevation of the extremity may help with symptomatic relief<br>\\r\\nIf the acute presentation is felt to be less than 14 days old, strong consideration should be given to catheter directed thrombolytic therapy<br>\\r\\nAn initial endovascular approach may include catheter directed lytic therapy, percutaneous thrombectomy, and balloon angioplasty, but should not include stenting as an initial strategy. Until the mechanical obstruction is relieved, the present of stent will increase the risk of rethrombosis<br>\\r\\nSurgical referral for removal of the mechanical issue which lead to the event<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In the current era, there is evidence to suggest that if an aggressive approach to this condition is taken, the incidence of post thrombotic syndrome may be decreased from 53% to 12- 25% (3)<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Given the lack of randomized clinical trials, many areas of controversy remain regarding patient management including:<br>\\r\\nthe true benefit of lytic therapy over heparin therapy<br>\\r\\nwhether or not adjunctive therapies such as EKOS system and others have any additional benefit in this population<br>\\r\\nthe dose and duration of lytic therapy<br>\\r\\nthe timing of surgical decompressive therapy (in hospital, versus at 3 months post anticoagulation)<br>\\r\\nthe best treatment of the affected vein post decompressive therapy (stenting versus a surgical approach)<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Given these controversies this area remains rich for further study. However current expert consensus recommends an aggressive strategy in this young, active patient population. It is hoped that future guidelines will seek to address a more unified consensus opinion than the current anticoagulation guidelines.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4>References:<\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>Illig KA, Doyle AJ.

In a retrospective study of 329 patients with critical limb ischemia followed for a mean of 18 months, those who underwent revascularization according the angiosome concept had more favorable limb outcomes (4). After propensity score matching, freedom from amputation was 82% +\\/-5% for limbs that were successfully revascularized according to the angiosome concept but 68% +\\/-5% (p=0.01) for the group with indirect revascularization (4). Similar benefits were seen in a retrospective series of 48 patients with non-healing wounds who underwent tibioperoneal bypass (5).<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Limitations of the angiosome concept<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>First, more evidence is needed to firmly support angiosome-guided revascularization. Second, it is not always technically feasible to revascularize the artery supplying a wound. Third, the ability to achieve revascularization in the angiosome of interest may be a surrogate for less severe disease, rather than a sign of true therapeutic benefit. Despite these limitations, it is our practice to pursue angiosome-guided revascularization if technically feasible based on the available evidence and the biologic plausibility of clinical benefit.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>References about angiosomes<\\/h2>\\r\\n<ol><li>Slovut DP, Sullivan TM.

The challenge that plagues such novel technologies is a lack of patient level data on their effectiveness and safety.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>DEFINITE LE is a promising first step in addressing this knowledge gap for directional atherectomy (DA) devices. It is an industry funded (covedian) prospective, multinational, single-arm study designed to evaluate the short and long term (12-month) safety and effectiveness of DA for percutaneous treatment of 598 subjects with claudication and 201 subjects with critical limb ischemia (CLI) across 47 sites in the U.S. and Europe.

In fact, major trials (such as <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.angiologist.com\\/?p=10816\\\">BEST<\\/a>) are likely to be powered for this or a similar endpoint. However, limb therapies probably only affect the amputation component of this composite outcome, as mortality in CLI patients is often due to cardiac causes (1). In addition, amputation-free survival does not always correspond to a patient being ambulatory and living independently. Revascularization is a cornerstone in the management of patients with CLI. However, <em>patency<\\/em> \\u2013 another traditional outcome &mdash; does not preclude limb salvage. In a meta-analysis of 30 studies (2557) patients with CLI undergoing below-knee revascularization, 1-year patency following endovascular therapy was only 58.1 +\\/- 4.6%, but limb salvage was 86 +\\/- 2.7% (2). As a corollary, patency does not ensure the optimal clinical outcome. In a series of 1012 patients undergoing infra-inguinal bypass for CLI, 20% of those with patent grafts at 1 year remained symptomatic or had undergone amputation (3). Though important for the clinical care of patients with critical limb ischemia, lower extremity hemodynamics (eg., ankle-brachial indices) is a surrogate for patency in many respects.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Functional Outcomes after Critical Limb Ischemia therapy<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Treadmill testing protocols (graded and constant load) and 6-minute walk tests have been well studied in patients with claudication and also have good test characteristics (4). However, is it reasonable to expect a patient with a painful wound that is appropriately dressed and offloaded to walk on a treadmill? Is loss of distance walked post intervention a treatment failure for a CLI patient if that patient is still able to walk at all and live independently? Other functional tests are also being studied in patients with CLI such as the summary performance score (composite of 4-meter walk test, balance test, sit-stand test), vertical accelerometry, and isometric muscle strength measurements (5).<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Patient reported outcomes<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Multiple patient-reported outcomes have been studied in peripheral arterial disease. Some of these instruments are disease-specific; that is, they were derived and validated in populations with peripheral artery disease. Examples include the Walking Impairment Questionnaire, the Nottingham Health Profile, PADQOL, and VASCUQOL. However, no questionnaire has been designed specifically for CLI patients, excluding claudicants.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Wound healing as an outcome of critical limb ischemia therapy<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Wound healing is an important limb outcome for CLI trials. The definition of wound healing is typically a wound that remains healed for 2 weeks. Core labs exist for the assessment of wound healing. The time to wound healing and the resources required to achieve wound healing (revascularization procedures, surgical debridements, totality of wound care) should be considered.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Conclusions<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>In conclusion, there are challenges in choosing the optimal outcome assessment tools when designing a trial of CLI therapies. Amputation-free survival is likely to always be of interest. Refining the functional assessment of patients with CLI with non-walking functional tests, such as those listed above, may be of use. Developing a CLI-specific questionnaire that assesses quality of life and function would improve outcome assessment in this disease. Constructing an endpoint of \\u2018limb health\\u2019 &mdash; comprised of wound healing, function, and lack of pain \\u2013 would be of value when comparing therapies in CLI patients. Eventually, cost-effectiveness analyses will be important after optimal management strategies and outcome assessments have been better elucidated.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>References<\\/h2>\\r\\n<ol><li>Becker F, Robert-Ebadi H, Ricco JB, Setacci C, Cao P, de Donato G, et al.

The rate of new symptomatic PE through 12 months was 0 percent (0\\/129). There were no instances of filter tilting, migration, embolization, fracture, IVC perforation through 12 months or device-related deaths. The rate of successful Sentry bioconversion was 95.7 percent at six months and 96.4 percent at 12 months, an improvement over published retrieval rates.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Two-Year Results from the IN.PACT Global Study<br><\\/strong>Presented by Thomas Zeller, M.D.<br>IN.PACT Global is a multicenter, international, prospective, single-arm study designed to expand on clinical evidence with the In.Pact Admiral drug-coated balloon (DCB) (Medtronic) for the treatment of real-world patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal disease. To date, IN.PACT Global is the largest independently adjudicated DCB study of real-world patients with femoropopliteal artery disease. Two-year results demonstrate consistent and durable clinical performance, and confirm the positive results observed in the IN.PACT SFA randomized trial.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Insights from the Zilver PTX Study in Japan<br><\\/strong>Presented by Michael Dake, M.D.<br>The first 900 patients in Japan treated with drug-eluting stents were enrolled in the Zilver PTX study. Nine hundred and five patients with 1,080 lesions were enrolled at 95 institutions. Comorbidities included a high incidence of chronic kidney disease (44 percent) and critical limb ischemia (21 percent). The current study continues to show positive outcomes through four years. For the challenging subgroups evaluated, results were similar and favorable through two years, indicating that the Zilver PTX DES may be a valid treatment option for patients with these difficult-to-treat lesions.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Primary Patency of the BioMimics 3D Helical Stent: Significant Outcome from the Mimics Study<br><\\/strong>Presented by Thomas Zeller, M.D.<br>The BioMimics 3D helical stent (Veryan Medical, Ltd.) has a 3D helical centerline designed to impart nonplanar curvature to the vessel, promoting swirling blood flow. The study randomized 76 patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease 2:1 to either BioMimics 3D or LifeStent (Bard Peripheral Vascular). A statistically significant difference was observed in primary patency through 24 months. These data support the BioMimics 3D helical stent in primary stenting of complex lesions and point to potential for complementary use with DCBs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Four-Year Results of the IN.PACT SFA Trial: Drug-Coated Balloon Catheter vs. an Uncoated Balloon Catheter in Femoropopliteal Lesions<br><\\/strong>Presented by Peter Schneider, M.D.<br>IN.PACT SFA enrolled 331 patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal lesions.&nbsp; Four-year results of the IN.PACT SFA trial demonstrated sustained treatment effect in maintaining significantly higher freedom from CD-TLR by KM estimate in patients treated with the In.Pact Admiral DCB compared to PTA despite a late catch-up effect. Among patients requiring reintervention, the mean time to the first event was significantly longer in the DCB group.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>About VIVA Physicians<br><\\/strong><em>VIVA Physicians, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to advancing the field of vascular medicine and intervention through education and research, strives to be the premier educator in the field.

Marianne Brodmann, M.D., of the Medical University of Graz in Austria, presented the data today as a late-breaking trial at the Vascular Interventional Advances (<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/vivaphysicians.org\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">VIVA 17<\\/a>) Annual Conference. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The ILLUMENATE EU RCT, which is part of a series of five trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of Stellarex for superficial femoral artery and popliteal disease, includes 328 PAD patients from 18 centers across Germany and Austria and compares the Stellarex DCB to an uncoated angioplasty balloon. The results show that at 24 months, 75.9% of patients treated with Stellarex maintained blood flow through the treated segment of the diseased artery, assessed through blinded core-lab adjudicated patency. Only 61.0% of patients treated with an uncoated balloon still maintained blood flow at 24 months. The data shows that Stellarex demonstrates higher efficacy and patency results, and longer treatment durability compared to an uncoated balloon, which is the current standard of care in the United States.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\\"The Stellarex DCB produced durable results in this rigorous trial, validating earlier findings among the ILLUMENATE trial series,\\\" stated Marianne Brodmann, M.D. \\\"These consistent, top-tier outcomes are achieved with a low-dose balloon.* Stellarex is the first low-dose DCB to demonstrate a significant treatment effect at two years.\\\"<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The ILLUMENATE EU RCT has independent evaluation including supervision by a clinical events committee, a data safety and monitoring board, and assessment by angiographic and duplex ultrasound core laboratories. Philips Spectranetics fully funded the ILLUMENATE EU RCT as part of the ILLUMENATE series of five trials to evaluate the benefits of Stellarex .035\\\" for various patient groups in comparison to an uncoated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon, which is the current endovascular standard of care. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\\"We are committed to providing proven clinical solutions that positively impact patient outcomes,\\\" stated Christopher Barys, Image Guided Therapy Devices Business Leader for Philips. \\\"We are proud to have the only low-dose drug-coated balloon with a proven treatment effect at two years compared to the current endovascular standard of care in the U.S. The addition of Stellarex in the Philips portfolio through the Spectranetics acquisition reinforces our commitment to helping physicians decide, guide, treat and confirm the right therapy for their patients.\\\"<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The Stellarex drug-coated balloon is designed to restore and maintain blood flow to arteries in patients with peripheral arterial disease.

Since its first symposium in 2003, VIVA has provided state-of-the-art education for physicians with an interest and commitment to vascular and endovascular medicine. VIVA\'s unique Laptop Learning system has allowed participants to engage in pre- and post-testing to determine their level of knowledge and gauge their improvement over the week of VIVA\'s annual conference. We have pooled these questions and added many more, as well as provided explanations of correct and incorrect answers to create a true study guide. This is designed not only for those physicians interested in sitting for the American Board of Vascular Medicine General and Endovascular board certification examinations, but also as a guide for any physicians who care for patients with vascular disease. Features:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul><li>Five comprehensive practice exams, each containing approximately 50 multiple choice questions<\\/li><li>Complete answer explanations for further understanding of each question<\\/li><li>Full color images of scans, tests, and patient conditions<\\/li><li>Ideal review for the American Board of Vascular Medicine examinations<\\/li><\\/ul>\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/dp\\/0615696449\\/ref=cm_sw_su_dp\\\" class=\\\"angle-link\\\">Purchase<\\/a><\\/p>\",\"180\":\"<p><strong>COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW IN VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR TEXTBOOK<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><em>Editors of the book are David P.

Marianne Brodmann, M.D., of the Medical University of Graz in Austria, presented the data today as a late-breaking trial at the Vascular Interventional Advances (<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/vivaphysicians.org\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">VIVA 17<\\/a>) Annual Conference. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The ILLUMENATE EU RCT, which is part of a series of five trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of Stellarex for superficial femoral artery and popliteal disease, includes 328 PAD patients from 18 centers across Germany and Austria and compares the Stellarex DCB to an uncoated angioplasty balloon. The results show that at 24 months, 75.9% of patients treated with Stellarex maintained blood flow through the treated segment of the diseased artery, assessed through blinded core-lab adjudicated patency. Only 61.0% of patients treated with an uncoated balloon still maintained blood flow at 24 months. The data shows that Stellarex demonstrates higher efficacy and patency results, and longer treatment durability compared to an uncoated balloon, which is the current standard of care in the United States.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\\"The Stellarex DCB produced durable results in this rigorous trial, validating earlier findings among the ILLUMENATE trial series,\\\" stated Marianne Brodmann, M.D. \\\"These consistent, top-tier outcomes are achieved with a low-dose balloon.* Stellarex is the first low-dose DCB to demonstrate a significant treatment effect at two years.\\\"<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The ILLUMENATE EU RCT has independent evaluation including supervision by a clinical events committee, a data safety and monitoring board, and assessment by angiographic and duplex ultrasound core laboratories. Philips Spectranetics fully funded the ILLUMENATE EU RCT as part of the ILLUMENATE series of five trials to evaluate the benefits of Stellarex .035\\\" for various patient groups in comparison to an uncoated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon, which is the current endovascular standard of care. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\\"We are committed to providing proven clinical solutions that positively impact patient outcomes,\\\" stated Christopher Barys, Image Guided Therapy Devices Business Leader for Philips. \\\"We are proud to have the only low-dose drug-coated balloon with a proven treatment effect at two years compared to the current endovascular standard of care in the U.S. The addition of Stellarex in the Philips portfolio through the Spectranetics acquisition reinforces our commitment to helping physicians decide, guide, treat and confirm the right therapy for their patients.\\\"<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The Stellarex drug-coated balloon is designed to restore and maintain blood flow to arteries in patients with peripheral arterial disease.

The 30-day results of the 76 women and 149 men enrolled show that compared to men, women had more complex anatomy. Technical success was achieved in 100% of the women and 98.6% of the men. No women underwent a secondary intervention for endoleak, occlusion\\/stenosis, or migration compared to two reinterventions in the male arm for type Ia endoleak. The early results of the LUCY study show that women derive similar benefits with the Ovation system compared to men.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Six-Month Results of the PREVEIL Early Feasibility Study for the SurVeil DCB <br><\\/strong>Presented by Gary Ansel, M.D. <br>PREVEIL is a prospective, United States, multicenter, single-arm trial to assess the safety and feasibility of the SurVeil drug-coated balloon (DCB) (Surmodics) in the treatment of subjects with de novo lesions of the femoropopliteal artery. The study enrolled 13 patients at three clinical sites with symptomatic femoropopliteal lesions \\u2264 90 mm in length. Acute success measures of safety were achieved in 100% of subjects. At 6 months, subjects treated with the SurVeil DCB demonstrated primary patency of 100% and mean late lumen loss of 0.27 \\u00b1 0.54 mm. Subjects experienced significant improvement in Rutherford classification, ankle-brachial\\/toe-brachial index, 6-minute walk test, and walking impairment questionnaire at 30 days and 6 months. Median plasma concentration peaked immediately postprocedure (Cmax 1.07 ng\\/mL) and was undetectable at 30 days. Secondary technical, device, and procedural success criteria were achieved.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>The PRELUDE Study: Prospective Study for the Treatment of Atherosclerotic Lesions in the Superficial Femoral and\\/or Popliteal Arteries Using the Serranator Device <br><\\/strong>Presented by Marianne Brodmann, M.D. <br>This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of the Serranator Alto percutaneous transluminal angioplasty serration balloon catheter (Cagent Vascular) in subjects with atherosclerotic disease of the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. The device has four external metal serrated strips embedded on a semicompliant balloon to create multiple longitudinal lines of interrupted microserrations to aid arterial expansion. Subjects with stenosis &gt; 70%, lesion length \\u2264 10 cm, and reference vessel diameters of 4 to 6 mm were included. Occlusions were allowed up to 6 cm in length. The primary safety endpoint was a composite of major adverse events plus perioperative death 30-days postprocedure. The primary efficacy endpoint is defined by device success with a final diameter stenosis &lt; 50%. Twenty-five patients were enrolled at four study centers. The average pretreatment stenosis was 88% with a posttreatment stenosis of 23%. Only one stent was placed (4%) post-Serranator. There were no major adverse events or perioperative deaths at 30 days. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Use of a DCB to Treat Obstructive Lesions in the Superficial Femoral and Popliteal Arteries: Preliminary Results from the SAFE-DCB Trial <br><\\/strong>Presented by Edward Woo, M.D. <br>SAFE-DCB is a prospective, United States multicenter study designed to assess the on-label use of the Lutonix 035 DCB catheter (Bard Peripheral Vascular) for the treatment of de novo or restenotic lesions in the native superficial femoral or popliteal arteries in a real-world patient population. A total of 968 patients at 74 centers fulfilled all the study requirements. This per-protocol group had symptoms of intermittent claudication or critical limb ischemia, obstructive lesions up to 150 mm in length, and reference vessel diameters of 4 to 7 mm.&nbsp;To date, 627 per-protocol patients have reached the 12-month follow-up, and all evaluable 12-month data are included in this analysis. An early look at the primary endpoints showed the 30-day freedom from safety events was 98.5%, while 12-month freedom from target lesion revascularization was 90.8%. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>First-in-Human Experience With Endovascular Aneurysm Repair Using the Ovation Alto Stent Graft <br><\\/strong>Presented by Sean Lyden, M.D. <br>This case review evaluated the first-in-human experience with the newest-generation Ovation stent graft, the Ovation Alto (Endologix), intended to accommodate the widest range of anatomies for on-label endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) compared to other commercially available devices. Described in the review are the first seven patients treated with the Ovation Alto stent graft at a single center from August 2016 to February 2017. The ability of the Ovation Alto to fundamentally expand EVAR indications mainly relate to the unique sealing mechanism and the delivery system. Ovation Alto was successfully delivered and deployed in all patients with 100% technical success. At 30-day follow-up, no type I or III endoleaks, stent graft migrations, abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, abdominal aortic aneurysm\\u2013related mortality, or secondary intervention were reported. <\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>About VIVA Physicians <br><\\/em><\\/strong><em>VIVA Physicians strive to be the premier educators in the field of vascular medicine and intervention.

Jaff, DO; Ido Weinberg, MD; Beau Hawkins, MD<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The Vascular and Endovascular Medicine Study Guide is a 10-year compilation of examination questions and content from VIVA and other expert contributors. Since its first symposium in 2003, VIVA has provided state-of-the-art education for physicians with an interest and commitment to vascular and endovascular medicine. VIVA\'s unique Laptop Learning system has allowed participants to engage in pre- and post-testing to determine their level of knowledge and gauge their improvement over the week of VIVA\'s annual conference.

He and his colleagues were the first to advocate an aggressive approach to saving limbs threatened by arteriosclerosis and gangrene when most patients with this problem were being treated by a major amputation.  He and his group were recognized as world leaders in this field. \\r\\nIn the 1990s, Dr. Veith, an advocate of endovascular treatments, became involved with endovascular grafts, using them to treat a variety of vascular lesions.  Many of the procedures he and his associates performed were \\u201cfirsts,\\u201d including the first endovascular graft repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or EVAR in the US and an EVAR for a ruptured abdominal aneurysm. He was elected President of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and was a major force promoting the endovascular treatment.\\r\\nDr. Veith held positions as Chief of Vascular Surgery and Chairman of Surgery at Montefiore Medical Center-Albert Einstein College of Medicine for many years.  He was also The William J. Von Liebig Chair in Vascular Surgery at these institutions. In 2006, Dr. Veith was appointed to his present positions, at New York University and the Cleveland Clinic.

He and his colleagues were the first to advocate an aggressive approach to saving limbs threatened by arteriosclerosis and gangrene when most patients with this problem were being treated by a major amputation.  He and his group were recognized as world leaders in this field. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990s, Dr. Veith, an advocate of endovascular treatments, became involved with endovascular grafts, using them to treat a variety of vascular lesions.  Many of the procedures he and his associates performed were \\u201cfirsts,\\u201d including the first endovascular graft repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or EVAR in the US and an EVAR for a ruptured abdominal aneurysm. He was elected President of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and was a major force promoting the endovascular treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Veith held positions as Chief of Vascular Surgery and Chairman of Surgery at Montefiore Medical Center-Albert Einstein College of Medicine for many years.  He was also The William J. Von Liebig Chair in Vascular Surgery at these institutions. In 2006, Dr. Veith was appointed to his present positions, at New York University and the Cleveland Clinic.

He serves as Principal Investigator of a broad range of randomized clinical trials and observational studies related to the prevention, treatment, and epidemiology of venous thromboembolism, stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and novel oral anticoagulants.  Dr. Goldhaber showed through a series of clinical trials that right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis predict an adverse prognosis in acute pulmonary embolism.  Furthermore, these trials showed that systemic and catheter-based ultrasound-facilitated thrombolytic therapy more rapidly than heparin restored normal right ventricular function.  He also conducted a randomized trial demonstrating that electronic medical alerts for high risk hospitalized patients not receiving venous thromboembolism prophylaxis reduce the symptomatic DVT and pulmonary embolism rates by more than 40%.  For his work on prevention of venous thromboembolism, Dr. Goldhaber received the Certificate of Appreciation from the Surgeon General of the United States.  In 2015, he received the Distinguished Scientist Award from the American Heart Association.  Dr. Goldhaber directs a series of Harvard Medical School courses. Dr. Goldhaber is President and Founding Director of the nonprofit organization, North American Thrombosis Forum (www.NATFonline.org), which focuses on thrombosis education for healthcare providers, patients, and the public.

Goldhaber, MD, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, is Interim Chief of the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Section Head of Vascular Medicine, and Director of the Thrombosis Research Group at Brigham and Women\\u2019s Hospital.  He serves as Principal Investigator of a broad range of randomized clinical trials and observational studies related to the prevention, treatment, and epidemiology of venous thromboembolism, stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and novel oral anticoagulants.  Dr. Goldhaber showed through a series of clinical trials that right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis predict an adverse prognosis in acute pulmonary embolism.  Furthermore, these trials showed that systemic and catheter-based ultrasound-facilitated thrombolytic therapy more rapidly than heparin restored normal right ventricular function.  He also conducted a randomized trial demonstrating that electronic medical alerts for high risk hospitalized patients not receiving venous thromboembolism prophylaxis reduce the symptomatic DVT and pulmonary embolism rates by more than 40%.  For his work on prevention of venous thromboembolism, Dr. Goldhaber received the Certificate of Appreciation from the Surgeon General of the United States.  In 2015, he received the Distinguished Scientist Award from the American Heart Association.  Dr. Goldhaber directs a series of Harvard Medical School courses. Dr. Goldhaber is President and Founding Director of the nonprofit organization, North American Thrombosis Forum (www.NATFonline.org), which focuses on thrombosis education for healthcare providers, patients, and the public.  At Brigham and Women\\u2019s Hospital, he runs a busy outpatient practice of general cardiology, venous thromboembolism, and atrial fibrillation patients, and oversees the inpatient Cardiology Consult Service.\"}}}}}', '2018-03-07 23:07:04', '2018-03-07 23:07:04', 'b8f86f6a-e9b2-4c71-ac11-332a19670a56'),

He and his colleagues were the first to advocate an aggressive approach to saving limbs threatened by arteriosclerosis and gangrene when most patients with this problem were being treated by a major amputation.  He and his group were recognized as world leaders in this field. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990s, Dr. Veith, an advocate of endovascular treatments, became involved with endovascular grafts, using them to treat a variety of vascular lesions.  Many of the procedures he and his associates performed were \\u201cfirsts,\\u201d including the first endovascular graft repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or EVAR in the US and an EVAR for a ruptured abdominal aneurysm. He was elected President of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and was a major force promoting the endovascular treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Veith held positions as Chief of Vascular Surgery and Chairman of Surgery at Montefiore Medical Center-Albert Einstein College of Medicine for many years.  He was also The William J. Von Liebig Chair in Vascular Surgery at these institutions. In 2006, Dr. Veith was appointed to his present positions, at New York University and the Cleveland Clinic.

Thereafter he achieved success with his pioneering work in experimental and clinical lung transplantation.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 70s and 80s, his attention turned toward Vascular Surgery with an emphasis on lower extremity revascularization procedures. He and his colleagues were the first to advocate an aggressive approach to saving limbs threatened by arteriosclerosis and gangrene when most patients with this problem were being treated by a major amputation.  He and his group were recognized as world leaders in this field. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990s, Dr. Veith, an advocate of endovascular treatments, became involved with endovascular grafts, using them to treat a variety of vascular lesions.  Many of the procedures he and his associates performed were \\u201cfirsts,\\u201d including the first endovascular graft repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or EVAR in the US and an EVAR for a ruptured abdominal aneurysm. He was elected President of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and was a major force promoting the endovascular treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Veith held positions as Chief of Vascular Surgery and Chairman of Surgery at Montefiore Medical Center-Albert Einstein College of Medicine for many years.  He was also The William J. Von Liebig Chair in Vascular Surgery at these institutions. In 2006, Dr. Veith was appointed to his present positions, at New York University and the Cleveland Clinic.

Thereafter he achieved success with his pioneering work in experimental and clinical lung transplantation.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 70s and 80s, his attention turned toward Vascular Surgery with an emphasis on lower extremity revascularization procedures. He and his colleagues were the first to advocate an aggressive approach to saving limbs threatened by arteriosclerosis and gangrene when most patients with this problem were being treated by a major amputation.  He and his group were recognized as world leaders in this field. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990s, Dr. Veith, an advocate of endovascular treatments, became involved with endovascular grafts, using them to treat a variety of vascular lesions.  Many of the procedures he and his associates performed were \\u201cfirsts,\\u201d including the first endovascular graft repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or EVAR in the US and an EVAR for a ruptured abdominal aneurysm. He was elected President of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and was a major force promoting the endovascular treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Veith held positions as Chief of Vascular Surgery and Chairman of Surgery at Montefiore Medical Center-Albert Einstein College of Medicine for many years.  He was also The William J. Von Liebig Chair in Vascular Surgery at these institutions. In 2006, Dr. Veith was appointed to his present positions, at New York University and the Cleveland Clinic.

Thereafter he achieved success with his pioneering work in experimental and clinical lung transplantation.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 70s and 80s, his attention turned toward Vascular Surgery with an emphasis on lower extremity revascularization procedures. He and his colleagues were the first to advocate an aggressive approach to saving limbs threatened by arteriosclerosis and gangrene when most patients with this problem were being treated by a major amputation.  He and his group were recognized as world leaders in this field. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990s, Dr. Veith, an advocate of endovascular treatments, became involved with endovascular grafts, using them to treat a variety of vascular lesions.  Many of the procedures he and his associates performed were \\u201cfirsts,\\u201d including the first endovascular graft repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or EVAR in the US and an EVAR for a ruptured abdominal aneurysm. He was elected President of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and was a major force promoting the endovascular treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Veith held positions as Chief of Vascular Surgery and Chairman of Surgery at Montefiore Medical Center-Albert Einstein College of Medicine for many years.  He was also The William J. Von Liebig Chair in Vascular Surgery at these institutions. In 2006, Dr. Veith was appointed to his present positions, at New York University and the Cleveland Clinic.

He serves as Principal Investigator of a broad range of randomized clinical trials and observational studies related to the prevention, treatment, and epidemiology of venous thromboembolism, stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and novel oral anticoagulants.  Dr. Goldhaber showed through a series of clinical trials that right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis predict an adverse prognosis in acute pulmonary embolism.  Furthermore, these trials showed that systemic and catheter-based ultrasound-facilitated thrombolytic therapy more rapidly than heparin restored normal right ventricular function.  He also conducted a randomized trial demonstrating that electronic medical alerts for high risk hospitalized patients not receiving venous thromboembolism prophylaxis reduce the symptomatic DVT and pulmonary embolism rates by more than 40%.  For his work on prevention of venous thromboembolism, Dr. Goldhaber received the Certificate of Appreciation from the Surgeon General of the United States.  In 2015, he received the Distinguished Scientist Award from the American Heart Association.  Dr. Goldhaber directs a series of Harvard Medical School courses. Dr. Goldhaber is President and Founding Director of the nonprofit organization, North American Thrombosis Forum (www.NATFonline.org), which focuses on thrombosis education for healthcare providers, patients, and the public.

He serves as Principal Investigator of a broad range of randomized clinical trials and observational studies related to the prevention, treatment, and epidemiology of venous thromboembolism, stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and novel oral anticoagulants.  Dr. Goldhaber showed through a series of clinical trials that right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis predict an adverse prognosis in acute pulmonary embolism.  Furthermore, these trials showed that systemic and catheter-based ultrasound-facilitated thrombolytic therapy more rapidly than heparin restored normal right ventricular function.  He also conducted a randomized trial demonstrating that electronic medical alerts for high risk hospitalized patients not receiving venous thromboembolism prophylaxis reduce the symptomatic DVT and pulmonary embolism rates by more than 40%.  For his work on prevention of venous thromboembolism, Dr. Goldhaber received the Certificate of Appreciation from the Surgeon General of the United States.  In 2015, he received the Distinguished Scientist Award from the American Heart Association.  Dr. Goldhaber directs a series of Harvard Medical School courses. Dr. Goldhaber is President and Founding Director of the nonprofit organization, North American Thrombosis Forum (www.NATFonline.org), which focuses on thrombosis education for healthcare providers, patients, and the public.  At Brigham and Women\\u2019s Hospital, he runs a busy outpatient practice of general cardiology, venous thromboembolism, and atrial fibrillation patients, and oversees the inpatient Cardiology Consult Service.\"}}}}}', '2018-03-15 16:43:34', '2018-03-15 16:43:34', '24193697-c8ee-47eb-91ea-7a11d145ebb4'),

Thereafter he achieved success with his pioneering work in experimental and clinical lung transplantation.  \r\n\r\nIn the 70s and 80s, his attention turned toward Vascular Surgery with an emphasis on lower extremity revascularization procedures. He and his colleagues were the first to advocate an aggressive approach to saving limbs threatened by arteriosclerosis and gangrene when most patients with this problem were being treated by a major amputation.  He and his group were recognized as world leaders in this field. \r\n\r\nIn the 1990s, Dr. Veith, an advocate of endovascular treatments, became involved with endovascular grafts, using them to treat a variety of vascular lesions.  Many of the procedures he and his associates performed were “firsts,” including the first endovascular graft repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or EVAR in the US and an EVAR for a ruptured abdominal aneurysm. He was elected President of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and was a major force promoting the endovascular treatment.\r\n\r\nDr. Veith held positions as Chief of Vascular Surgery and Chairman of Surgery at Montefiore Medical Center-Albert Einstein College of Medicine for many years.  He was also The William J. Von Liebig Chair in Vascular Surgery at these institutions. In 2006, Dr. Veith was appointed to his present positions, at New York University and the Cleveland Clinic.  Over the years, he has received numerous awards and honors as a leader, outstanding teacher and innovator in Vascular Surgery. He chairs a large Vascular meeting, the VEITHsymposium, held annually in New York City.  \r\n', '2018-02-13 22:17:53', '2018-03-15 16:43:34', '31dcb4e2-7ab9-4784-ae79-abe24cc68c2c');

Goldhaber, MD, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, is Interim Chief of the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Section Head of Vascular Medicine, and Director of the Thrombosis Research Group at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.  He serves as Principal Investigator of a broad range of randomized clinical trials and observational studies related to the prevention, treatment, and epidemiology of venous thromboembolism, stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and novel oral anticoagulants.  Dr. Goldhaber showed through a series of clinical trials that right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis predict an adverse prognosis in acute pulmonary embolism.  Furthermore, these trials showed that systemic and catheter-based ultrasound-facilitated thrombolytic therapy more rapidly than heparin restored normal right ventricular function.  He also conducted a randomized trial demonstrating that electronic medical alerts for high risk hospitalized patients not receiving venous thromboembolism prophylaxis reduce the symptomatic DVT and pulmonary embolism rates by more than 40%.  For his work on prevention of venous thromboembolism, Dr. Goldhaber received the Certificate of Appreciation from the Surgeon General of the United States.  In 2015, he received the Distinguished Scientist Award from the American Heart Association.  Dr. Goldhaber directs a series of Harvard Medical School courses. Dr. Goldhaber is President and Founding Director of the nonprofit organization, North American Thrombosis Forum (www.NATFonline.org), which focuses on thrombosis education for healthcare providers, patients, and the public.

 ('92', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' edoxaban marketed as savaysa daiichi sankyo tokyo an oral once daily factor xa inhibitor was approved by the fda on january 8 2015 for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in non valvular atrial fibrillation and for the treatment of venous thromboembolism vte in a press release issued by the fda the u s food and drug administration outlined a few reservations regarding the use of edoxaban in non valvular atrial fibrillation patients with creatinine clearance greater than 95 ml min had an increased rate of ischemic stroke with edoxaban as compared to warfarin such data does not exist regarding vte as part of its label edoxaban carries a boxed warning stating that edoxaban should not be used in non valvular atrial fibrillation patients with creatinine clearance greater than 95 ml min for the prevention of stroke for the treatment of vte edoxaban is only approved after a parenteral agent has been administered for 5 10 days the approval for the use of edoxaban in patients with non valvular atrial fibrillation is based on the engage af timi 48 study of 21 105 participants published in the new england journal of medicine in november 2013 this trial compared two doses of edoxaban to warfarin and revealed that the higher dose of edoxaban was non inferior to warfarin in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism 1 18% and 1 5% respectively edoxaban demonstrated significantly less major bleeding and lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage compared to warfarin however there was a significant increase in gastrointestinal bleeding events with edoxaban versus warfarin the recommended dose of edoxaban for non valvular atrial fibrillation is 60 mg once daily creatinine clearance should be assessed before initiating therapy with edoxaban in patients with creatinine clearance between 15 ml min and 50 ml min the dose should be reduced to 30 mg daily it is important to note that edoxaban has not been studied in patients with mechanical heart valves or moderate or severe mitral stenosis and therefore it is not recommended in these patients as with any anticoagulant the premature discontinuation of edoxaban in the absence of alternative anticoagulation can increase the risk of ischemic events the approval for use in venous thromboembolism patients was based on the hokusai venous thromboembolism study published in the new england journal of medicine in october 2013 this study randomized 8 292 patients with dvt or pe to receive warfarin or edoxaban edoxaban was non inferior to warfarin in reducing the rates of recurrent vte 3 2% versus 3 5% respectively edoxaban was also associated with a significant decrease in the primary safety outcome of first or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding compared to warfarin 8 5% vs 10 3% respectively p=0 004 for patients with normal renal function the recommended dose of edoxaban is 60 mg once daily following 5 10 days of a parenteral anticoagulant for patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 ml min and 50 ml min who weigh less than or equal to 60 kg or who are on concomitant p glycoprotein inhibitors the recommended dose of edoxaban is 30 mg once daily following a parenteral anticoagulant two important points were noted as part of the hokusai vte study that may set edoxaban apart from other new oral anticoagulants use of a parenteral agent because the hokusai vte trial included a run in phase with a parenteral agent unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin edoxaban is not approved without the use of a parenteral agent for

late breaking clinical trial presentations full summaries can be found at viva vporoom com first prospective multicenter study evaluating outcomes following evar in women vs men early results from the lucy study presented by jennifer ash m d the lucy study is the first prospective multicenter study to assess outcomes in women compared to men treated with the ovation stent graft system endologix for elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair the 30 day results of the 76 women and 149 men enrolled show that compared to men women had more complex anatomy technical success was achieved in 100% of the women and 98 6% of the men no women underwent a secondary intervention for endoleak occlusion stenosis or migration compared to two reinterventions in the male arm for type ia endoleak the early results of the lucy study show that women derive similar benefits with the ovation system compared to men six month results of the preveil early feasibility study for the surveil dcb presented by gary ansel m d preveil is a prospective united states multicenter single arm trial to assess the safety and feasibility of the surveil drug coated balloon dcb surmodics in the treatment of subjects with de novo lesions of the femoropopliteal artery the study enrolled 13 patients at three clinical sites with symptomatic femoropopliteal lesions 90 mm in length acute success measures of safety were achieved in 100% of subjects at 6 months subjects treated with the surveil dcb demonstrated primary patency of 100% and mean late lumen loss of 0 27 0 54 mm subjects experienced significant improvement in rutherford classification ankle brachial toe brachial index 6 minute walk test and walking impairment questionnaire at 30 days and 6 months median plasma concentration peaked

serranator alto percutaneous transluminal angioplasty serration balloon catheter cagent vascular in subjects with atherosclerotic disease of the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries the device has four external metal serrated strips embedded on a semicompliant balloon to create multiple longitudinal lines of interrupted microserrations to aid arterial expansion subjects with stenosis 70% lesion length 10 cm and reference vessel diameters of 4 to 6 mm were included occlusions were allowed up to 6 cm in length the primary safety endpoint was a composite of major adverse events plus perioperative death 30 days postprocedure the primary efficacy endpoint is defined by device success with a final diameter stenosis 50% twenty five patients were enrolled at four study centers the average pretreatment stenosis was 88% with a posttreatment stenosis of 23% only one stent was placed 4% post serranator there were no major adverse events or perioperative deaths at 30 days use of a

90 8% first in human experience with endovascular aneurysm repair using the ovation alto stent graft presented by sean lyden m d this case review evaluated the first in human experience with the newest generation ovation stent graft the ovation alto endologix intended to accommodate the widest range of anatomies for on label endovascular aneurysm repair evar compared to other commercially available devices described in the review are the first seven patients treated with the ovation alto stent graft at a single center from august 2016 to february 2017 the ability of the ovation alto to fundamentally expand evar indications mainly relate to the unique sealing mechanism and the delivery system ovation alto was successfully delivered and deployed in all patients with 100% technical

frequent calcifications and microcirculatory disturbance affecting the pedal loop and cutaneous perfusion toe gangrene in a patient presenting with critical limb ischemia given this generally hostile environment and a high propensity for recurrent stenosis there remains controversy regarding the optimal method of revascularization in symptomatic patients surgical bypass or endovascular therapy on the surface surgical bypass is potentially more invasive than endovascular approaches figure overview of relative advantages of surgery and endovascular therapy endo for cli the check box indicates comparative benefit however proponents of bypass cite the balloon angioplasty versus surgery for ischemia of the lower extremities trial basil 1 basil evaluated 452 patients with limb ischemia although only a minority actually received treatment randomization and concluded that surgery was better in patients with more than 2 years anticipated survival overall amputation free survival afs was approximately 70% in both treatment cohorts however polytetrafluorethylene grafts ptfe had an almost 40% lower amputation free survival at five years compared to saphenous vein bypass and of the 85% of patients who were not suitable for randomization the principle reason was absence of a viable conduit for bypass endovascular therapy was preferred in patients with lower anticipated survival and was associated with fewer icu days and as a result lower costs basil enrolled patients from 1999 to 2004 in the decade since the basil trial was completed numerous additional devices and strategies have emerged for the treatment of cli pts and basil may therefore not necessarily reflect contemporary outcomes with endovascular therapy single device trials have found comparable afs rates in the excell trial evaluating below knee bare metal stents amputation was avoided in 70% of rutherford 6 patients and nearly 100% of rutherford 4 patients at 12 months 2 primary patency for

angioplasty for long tibial lesions found 3 month restenosis in one quarter of patients complete wound healing in three of four and limb salvage in more than 95% 8 what do comparative studies inform us regarding the relative merits of surgery or endovascular therapy in a retrospective analysis zhan et al found equivalent improvements in limb perfusion as measured by toe pressures at a mean follow up of 13 surgical group to 15 endovascular group months major amputation was 11% in both treatment cohorts 9 a propensity score analysis of 1023 cli patients compared 208 matched pairs of patients with follow up out to five years following surgery or below knee angioplasty equal benefits were reported in both groups for repeat revascularization 21% surgery 18% endo subsequent bypass 5% vs 12% and major amputation 19% vs 17% 10 this data and changing patient demographics since the basil trial have resulted in endovascular therapy being adopted as a first line strategy in traditional surgical groups one recent study reported endovascular therapy as the initial treatment in 70% of patients referred for surgical evaluation 11 an evaluation of 295 endovascularly treated and 138 bypass patients 1 2 with autologous vein grafts found no differences in primary assisted or secondary patency amputation free survival or limb salvage however procedural mortality in the surgical group was more than double 6 0 vs 2 8% 11 the currently enrolling best endovascular strategy best cli trial sponsored by the national institute of health will provide additional and important data regarding long term measurable outcomes in cli patients randomized by treatment allocation results are not expected for at least five years however as with all large prospective randomized controlled trials a critical review will be necessary to determine the generalizability of the best cli results due to the large potential for randomization bias for now there is strong support for endovascular

 ('233', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' peripheral arterial disease is a prevalent disease affecting 8 million americans and is associated with significant morbidity like intermittent claudication critical limb ischemia and limb loss interventions for peripheral arterial disease have recently moved towards more endovascular procedures compared to traditional surgery primary approach for such endovascular procedures remains common femoral artery either contra lateral or ipsi lateral although commonly used access via the common femoral artery cfa is associated with significant risk of access site bleeding hematoma retro peritoneal bleeding psuedoaneurysm and a v fistula also the more commonly used contra lateral cfa approach has technical challenges especially with tortuousity occlusion of the iliac arteries pedal artery access has been described previously by many operators as an alternative to groin access currently this approach is usually reserved as secondary option after failed antegrade approach or as an adjunct for complex lesions in patients with critical limb ischemia this can be attributed to many factors including risk of occlusion of artery accessed specially in cases of single vessel run off lack of dedicated instruments spasm and effective hemostasis methods here we describe our new technique and experience with first 80 patients who underwent invasive management of pad via sole pedal access as the primary approach method for pedal access access under ultrasound guidance using a 21 gauge needle dp pt or peroneal artery was accessed either by counter puncture or direct puncture method fig 1 micropuncture wire is advanced under fluoroscopic guidance and if needed contrast angiography is performed to visualize the vessel anatomy once access is secured a 4f sheath is advanced partially in the vessel fig 2 at this time vasodilators such as nitroglycerine 100mcg and verapamil 2 5 mg are administered intra arterially and heparin is administered intravenously procedure a 4f 125cm hydrophilic catheter pre loaded with 0 018 wire is then advanced retrogradely to the bifurcation of aorta contrast angiography is performed if a lesion is identified prior to reaching bifurcation angiography is performed and attempt is made to cross the lesion with the 0 018 wire if needed interventions such as orbital atherectomy 1 25 burr and balloon angioplasty fig 3 are performed via the 4f sheath if a stent is required the sheath is upgraded to a sheath with 5f outer diameter which accommodates 6f equipment and using the 6f catheter stents are delivered fig 4 hemostasis hemostasis is achieved via a modified patent hemostasis technique similar to the trans radial procedure a trans radial band is applied at the access site and the balloon is inflated to 15 20mmhg while the sheath is removed at the same time fig 5 if there is no bleeding from access site air is removed slowly from the balloon to release the pressure on the artery until bleeding is observed once bleeding is noticed at the access site an additional 1 2 cc of air is used to inflate the balloon so that the bleeding stops this allows having sufficient pressure to achieve hemostasis without occluding the blood flow through the artery the band is kept in place for 30 minutes and then slowly decompressed over 5 10 minutes and removed if no bleeding is observed patients are allowed to mobilize at this time access site patency is checked follow up our practice is to evaluate the access site with clinical examination by the physician at 1 week and with duplex ultrasound at 1 month our experience we recently presented our data of consecutive 80 patients approached via this novel technique access was successfully obtained in 74 92% a total of 8 10% patients required femoral access for various reasons including failure to obtain pedal access spasm or need for additional support out of 80 patients 51 patients required intervention of which 45 88% were performed via pedal access only most notably there were no complications in these patients access site evaluation at 1 month was available in 71 of 74 patients accessed as 3 patients were lost to follow up all 71 patients had patent access site and no complications were observed discussion primary pedal access may be a safe and feasible alternative to traditional femoral approach pedal access has several advantages reduced rate of complications associated with femoral approach reduced procedure time less tortuosity compared to contra lateral femoral approach reduced radiation exposure due to shorter procedure time and less scatter radiation from lower extremity compared to abdomen shorter recovery time and early ambulation may increase patient comfort in published literature major retrospective case series have explored different methods of retrograde approach recently mustapha et al described their technique in a case series of 23 patients who were thought to be high risk of groin complications as primary approach they had no access site complications similar to our study walker et al described the largest reported case series of 228 cli patients with retrograde approach after failed antegrade approach in this series there was one access site occlusion and two pseudo aneurysms requiring covered stent placement 1 3% complication rate montero baker and colleagues had described 51 cases including 6 claudicants with pedal access after failed antegrade approach and reported 1 access site occlusion two perforations and hematomas our technique is extrapolated from our extensive trans radial experience as interventional cardiologist and learning curve might be longer for those who lack these skills also pedal access has limitations including significant lesions in below the knee arteries which may require treatment prior to approaching lesions above the knee conclusion in our limited single center experience primary pedal approach seems safe and feasible in future further analysis with comparison to femoral approach will shed more light on superiority of this approach our access site success rate of complications and procedural

 ('239', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' pulmonary embolism pe is a common and often fatal disease process whose clinical presentation and long term outcome is widely variable the natural evolution of pe ranges significantly with abrupt hemodynamic compromise and death within one hour for approximately 10% of all cases in contrast approximately one third of patients with deep venous thrombosis dvt present with asymptomatic pe the pathophysiologic consequences of an acute pe are primarily hemodynamic and manifest when approximately 30 50% of the pulmonary bed is obstructed when this obstruction approaches 75% the right ventricle rv must acutely generate a systolic pressure above 50 mm hg which a normal ventricle cannot accommodate this leads to rv ischemia and dysfunction and in severe cases septal shift resulting in left ventricular obstruction and significant hypotension early mortality is closely linked to the probability of recurrent pe with an associated death rate of approximately 25% this cascade of events can progress rapidly and if unrecognized and untreated pe mortality approaches approximately 30% although certain clinical signs and symptoms can help to guide the clinician towards the diagnosis of pe these are often nonspecific and lack adequate positive or negative predictive value for conclusive diagnosis therefore several objective measures should be employed to help risk stratify patients into massive high submassive intermediate and nonmassive low pe categories a patient meets criteria for massive pe when they present with systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm hg or a systolic pressure decrease greater than 40 mm hg from baseline for greater than 15 minutes additional criteria for massive pe include persistent hypotension requiring pressor support pulselessness or persistent bradycardia less than 40 bpm submassive pe criteria include evidence of rv dysfunction rv chamber dilation either by echocardiogram or computed tomography ekg changes or elevated biomarkers troponin i or t or brain naturietic peptide nonmassive pe do not meet criteria for either massive or submassive pe early risk stratification for patients with pe is essential as mortality dramatically increases with escalating level of risk early mortality exceeds 15% for patients who meet criteria for massive pe within this subgroup mortality approaches 70% for those who require cardiopulmonary resuscitation vs approximately 25% for patients who present with shock even within the submassive pe subcategory rv dysfunction alone is associated with a 3 to 15% early mortality risk an rv diameter lv diameter ratio greater than 0 9 on chest ct is associated with an 82% thirty day adverse event rate odds ratio 4 0 this also portends to long term consequences as dysfunction that does not resolve at hospital discharge is associated with 13% risk of pe related mortality at three years in contrast there is a 4% three year mortality for patients with resolved rv dysfunction at hospital discharge other findings on echocardiogram can also indicate poor prognosis including severe rv free wall hypokinesis with sparing of the apex mcconnell s sign pulmonary hypertension tricuspid regurgitation and rv thrombus cardiac biomarkers also assist with short term prognostication where the odds ratio for short term mortality is 5 9 for patients with elevated troponin and is 9 5 and 5 7 for patients who present with elevated bnp or pro bnp respectively non massive pe carry significant less mortality burden with 1% of patients experiencing early death the long term all cause mortality of acute pe is significantly linked to concurrent clinical parameters which include advanced age malignancy neurodegenerative disease chronic renal disease and cardiovascular disease approximately one third of all patients who suffer a pe will die within 5 years and the predominant cause of long term mortality is associated cardiovascular disease finally it is important to consider longstanding pulmonary hypertension due to chronic thromboembolic disease affecting approximately 0 5 3% of all patients who experience pe references stein p matta f musani m

 ('241', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' aortic arch aneurysms present a significant clinical challenge despite improvements in operative techniques and peri operative care open repair of aortic arch aneurysms is still plagued by significant morbidity and mortality endovascular approaches have significantly altered our approach to aortic arch disease with the hopes of diminishing complications and mortality when considering endovascular repair however there are many notable obstacles that must be overcome in order to achieve successful exclusion of the aneurysm some of these mandates are not unique to endovascular repair of the arch such as the need for adequate length and diameter of the proximal and distal seal zones some obstacles however are unique to the arch and include the potential difficulty of navigating through tight arches maneuvering near the aortic valve preventing stroke and maintaining perfusion of the great vessels initial approaches to endovascular repair have relied upon extra anatomic debranching of the arch with inflow to the great vessels transitioned to a site away from the intended seal zones these debranching techniques have included bypasses using the ascending aorta as an inflow source or other extra anatomic locations such as the carotid arteries initial approaches to pure endovascular repair of the aortic arch involved the incorporation of a solitary branch designed initially for the subclavian artery these involved the placement of a fenestration reinforced hole or an actual branch incorporated into a thoracic endograft the fenestration or branch would be aligned with the subclavian artery and secured in place with a bridging stent one of the original series for this approach was reported by inoue et al in 1999 1 they described the placement of a branched aortic endograft within the aortic arch in 15 patients fourteen patients had a solitary branch while 1 had two branches their initial technical success complete exclusion of the aneurysm was 60% with 2 patients have access issues and 4 patients having an initial endoleak in a mean follow up of 12 months 73% of patients had complete exclusion of their arch aneurysm similar approaches have recently been employed by both medtronic and gore who have launched clinical trials to assess the outcomes of a single branched aortic arch branched endograft the incorporation of one branch however does not allow for the total endovascular repair of aortic arch pathologies without at least some hybrid approach to preserve flow to the left carotid and subclavian artery systems to overcome this and with the evolution of endovascular device designs several different devices have been described for the complete repair of the aortic arch with fenestrated and branched endografts one approach has been to apply in situ fenestrations to standard thoracic aortic endografts this can be accomplished with the use of a retrograde puncture of the endograft with the use of either a stiff wire system or a laser the fenestration is then reinforced with the placement of a bridging stent arch specific grafts have also been described the largest series comes from the mid term results of next gen fenestrated tevar trial in japan 2 the trial employs a customized precurved fenestrated endograft najuta stent graft kawasumi laboratories tokyo japan which is comprised of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membrane supported by self expanding z stents the device has 19 types of curved stent skeleton designs and 8 types of graft fenestrations the system was used in 393 patients with aortic arch aneurysms at 35 medical centers between 2010 and 2011 technical success ability to deliver and deploy the graft was achieved in 99% of patients with an initial success without type 1 or 3 endoleaks was achieved in 95% of patients thirty day mortality was only 1 5% and only 1 7% of patients had a neurologic event critics of the study however that durability of this system has yet to be demonstrated the use of a true branched endograft has been described by haulon et al 3 they describe the outcomes of 38 patients from 10 centers that underwent complete arch replacement with a branched aortic endograft the majority of the grafts had two branches that would allow for the incorporation of the innominate artery and the left carotid artery technical success placement of the endograft with incorporation of the branches and no type 1 or 3 endoleak was achieved in 84% of the patients in this high risk group 30 day mortality was 13 5% with a similar 13 5% rate of neurologic events twenty nine percent of the patients had evidence of an endoleak on pre discharge imaging with 5 proximal type 1 endoleaks 3 type 2 endoleaks 1 type 3 endoleak and 2 of unknown etiology two of the endoleaks required an early intervention and by 6 months of follow up the two indeterminate endoleaks and one of the type 1 endoleaks spontaneously resolved at a median follow up of 12 months 9% of the patients required a secondary intervention in addition there as a 12% late mortality none were aortic arch related the authors were able to demonstrate a significant learning curve with this technology when compared with the first 10 global cases the remainder of the cohort had significantly lower intraoperative complications operative time fluoroscopy time endoleak rates and secondary procedure rates the evolution of endovascular therapy is significantly changing our approaches to treating aortic disease this progress is clearly seen even in the complex setting of aortic arch pathology with improvement of device design and a growing global experience improved technical performance and immediate clinical outcomes will continue to improve clearly however we will need larger volume analysis over a significant period of time to better assess the durability of these devices in the setting of the aortic arch references inoue k

 ('251', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' the consideration to intervene on patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis aras has been controversial ever since blum s publication of 74 ostial aras cases there have been a number of single center and multicenter registries designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of renal artery stent deployment for aras in a recent meta analysis of 5 multicenter renal artery stent registries involving over 900 patients renal artery stent deployment did result in a meaningful reduction in systolic blood pressure however registries do not provide the highest level of evidence required to provide broad recommendations around indications for interventions in fact multisocietal guidelines documents provide relatively little guidance on the indications for renal artery stent deployment in patients with aras there have been many attempts at developing non invasive renal resistive index at the time of renal artery duplex ultrasonography brain natriuretic peptide assays and invasive translesional pressure gradients intravascular ultrasound and fractional flow reserve predictors of outcomes before the renal revascularization has been performed none of these have gained widespread utility within the past 6 years three major randomized trials have been published all suggesting that there is no advantage of stent vs optimal medical therapy in patients with aras these include the star and astral studies both of which specifically evaluated patients with chronic kidney disease ckd and aras the coral trial was designed to study patients with hypertension or ckd and aras with composite primary cardiovascular and renal endpoints in this challenging study with excellent trial oversight 947 patients with hypertension on at least 2 anti hypertensive medications or chronic kidney disease were randomized to optimal medical therapy or optimal medical therapy plus stent deployment with a primary endpoint evaluating cardiovascular and renal factors mortality myocardial infarction stroke need for dialysis there was no advantage to stent based therapy subset analysis did not identify a single group who benefitted from stent based therapy including those with global renal ischemia recurrent flash pulmonary edema or those with impaired renal function so is this the end of stenting for aras well if we had another decade and many more millions of dollars for clinical trials i think not clearly there are patient subgroups who potentially benefit from this intervention most notably those who truly fail a reasonable attempt at antihypertensive and lipid lowering therapy those patients were not studied in coral however in this era of affordable care i suspect that there is little appetite for another prospective multicenter randomized trial of the subsets of patients who really may benefit from this intervention for example those with very severe aras quantitative angiographic evidence of 80% aorto ostial lesions with physiologic evidence of hemodynamic significance translesional pressure gradients fractional flow reserve african americans with very severe hypertension fewer than 10% of the entire coral cohort were representative of this patient population and those patients recently committed to hemodialysis for aras we may be facing severe limitations in reimbursement for patients with aras and hypertension even if they were not sufficiently included in coral let this be a lesson to physicians we must be committed to clinical trials studying patients in whom data is lacking if we don t time and

 ('255', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' current acute ischemic stroke therapy has been guided by the recanalization hypothesis the concept that we must restore flow to ischemic but viable tissue by reopening the occluded vessel recanalization preserves threatened neural tissue improving patient outcome while recanalization may be spontaneous this can be more rapidly accomplished with intravenous iv and endovascular or intra arterial stroke therapy iat recently three well publicized randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate improved outcome with endovascular therapy over iv thrombolytic alone although the trials have shortcomings that limit the generalizability of the results to contemporary practice they have taught us powerful lessons that present a challenge and an opportunity for our field click on the image to enlarge angiograms ap view demonstrating a appearance of an internal carotid artery terminus occlusion with no antegrade cerebral perfusion b successful recanalization with resorted cerebral perfusion after thrombectomy the patient recovered with only minimal deficits mrs 1 at 90 days a stentriever following successful thrombectomy demonstrating the integration of clot these devices are the forefront of new techniques for successful vessel recanalization in acute stroke treatment as endovascular therapists the four main lessons learnt from these trials are iv therapy is beneficial for proximal large vessel occlusions every single eligible stroke patient should receive iv therapy we must improve our patient selection for iat the signal of benefit from iat is clearly smaller than was assumed we must target proximal large vessel occlusions when there is a large volume of neural tissue at risk we must be faster reducing the time from stroke onset to recanalization is key we must recanalize and reperfuse more efficiently older generation devices tested in the trials achieved successful recanalization in 50% of cases we can now achieve unprecedented rates of successful recanalization up to 90% however higher recanalization rates observed with iat has not translated into proportionally better outcomes these are where further opportunities lie we have learnt the distinction between tissue reperfusion and vessel recanalization a patent proximal vessel without restoration of the parenchymal blush and microvascular circulation is futile moreover in addition to selecting our patients for iat better establishing reperfusion as rapidly as possible by using the best endovascular techniques to achieve the highest reperfusion success we must also improve our clinical evaluation and assessment of iat as a therapeutic modality how do we accomplish all of these improving patient selection improving patient selection remains an area of controversy ultimately both clinical and imaging selection parameters should be evaluated patients with low nihss scores are probably unlikely to gain benefit from iat irrespective of the level of vascular occlusion pre procedural imaging should identify proximal large vessel occlusions and assess the extent of established tissue injury clinical outcomes is strongly tied to final infarct volume good clinical outcome is unlikely for patients with 70cc infarct volume with reperfusion of infarcts 100cc likely to cause harm these relevant threshold volumes may be much smaller for elderly patients mri dwi remains the gold standard for assessment of core volume ct techniques are also widely used improving treatment times improving treatment times requires initial stroke treatment process mapping measuring your clinical practice process and time metrics is a revealing exercise delivery of iv tpa is guided by the golden hour for iat the expectations are less clear comprehensive stroke center certification requires a generous door to iat time of 2 hours or less but despite this many stroke centers struggle to treat patients within this time frame rethinking our approach to logistics for these patients will deliver great time savings one measure with particularly high impact is parallel workflow streams for the individual role groups involved in delivering acute ischemic stroke care rather than working sequentially we can generate time savings by working concurrently sustained success requires a committed multidisciplinary team improving endovascular techniques improving endovascular techniques is a broader concept than simply using devices that reperfuse more efficiently the field is moving toward conscious sedation instead of general anesthesia following recent data that suggests better outcomes alternate techniques such as direct aspiration using large bore intracranial catheters and the new stentreiver devices are data driven approaches to recanalization and should be universally used finally the access systems used to deliver these devices to the clot face will be improved and will allow faster groin access to reperfusion times improving studies improving studies that evaluate iat is the final component we advocate better means of assessing outcomes standardizing approaches to treatment across institutions to allow easier and more informed comparisons and the validation of biomarkers e g time to reperfusion or final infarct volume the recent randomized trials have produced the positive effect of galvanizing the endovascular community towards generating evidence and have enhanced cooperation across the field as a result we should be maximizing the effect of this approaching iat in this multifaceted and comprehensive way will achieve that ultimate of goals improving our patients outcomes for severe acute ischemic stroke iat is a specific and potent therapy for a selected subset of patients applied correctly it has a power that is almost resurrective we are excited by the progress of the field and look forward to this next chapter of care for our stroke patients '),

each equipped with a sexy new moniker atherectomy exploring the evidence despite much investment and marketing by a handful of manufacturers atherectomy has yet to find an evidence based niche though widely accepted for debulking of calcified lesions to allow full stent expansion there is considerable debate over the long term patency afforded by a strategy of standalone atherectomy promising competing technologies such as fracture resistant stents and drug eluting balloons have stolen much of the limelight this is despite the built in appeal of performing a procedure where the atheroma is actually removed from the patient as opposed to pancaked to the vessel s intimal surface economic factors may also drive atherectomy use with reimbursement being substantially higher for femoropopliteal atherectomy $632 49 than stenting $518 17 per facility prices on www cms gov accessed july 12 2013 though personnel and equipment costs are higher with atherectomy than stenting there is still an institutional financial incentive that cannot be ignored http www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 18296016 atherectomy lends itself particularly well to common femoral ostial superficial femoral and popliteal artery intervention where stenting is unattractive especially in patients that are high risk for endarterectomy investigations of the use of atherectomy in conjunction with drug eluting balloons for lesions across joints are currently underway http www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 23147770 what then could explain the hesitancy to adopt a role for atherectomy compared with angioplasty and stenting atherectomies are longer more costly and labor intensive given the greater number of moving parts specialized guidewires embolic protection etc involved in the procedure demonstrating equivalence of atherectomy to angioplasty or stenting may not be sufficient to justify use though there are numerous single center registries reporting limb salvage rates with atherectomy alone

article aspx articleid=1206286 these trials have been criticized for qualifying the use of stents as a treatment failure a stent avoidant strategy has never been shown to result in favorable outcomes in fact drug eluting stents may end up as the gold standard for endovascular therapy in the superficial femoral artery the questions that need to be addressed in future trials are whether atherectomy with provisional stent placement beats a stenting only strategy and which debulking device yields the best long term patency the three categories of atherectomy tools currently approved by the fda are

the future of peripheral intervention this week in what s in my bag a sit down with dr michael bacharach bio medical school university of wisconsin clinical training internal medicine mayo clinic with emphasis in vascular medicine cardiology mayo clinic rochester minnesota interventional training mayo clinic rochester minnesota peripheral intervention training cleveland clinic hobbies hunting and fishing who or what was your inspiration for a career in vascular medicine dr bacharach ernst schneider a swiss german angiologist gave a lecture at the mayo clinic in 1986 he demonstrated all kinds of novel therapies including clot extraction and catheter based lytic therapy things nobody was doing and the time i was enthralled i thought that is what i want to do i met with the head of the mayo clinic at the time and ultimately designed a new curriculum for myself which included interventional radiology and vascular surgery this then allowed me to do a full year of dedicated vascular intervention training at the cleveland clinic how did you find sioux falls dr bacharach i had friends in sioux falls south dakota i gave a talk out there while i was still working in cleveland it was an integrated group that included cardiac surgeons who performed most of the vascular work initially i declined when they asked if i was interested after a few years in the cleveland clinic it became clear that i needed to find a new home i called them and i have been there for 20 years describe clinical practice in sioux falls how would you describe the pace dr bacharach last year we did 760 vascular cases this is one of the benefits of living in a geographically isolated region with a large catchment area do you still practice coronary intervention dr bacharach i consider myself a vascular medicine guy who trained in cardiology i rarely perform coronary intervention though i am current developing a tavr program and perform 4 5 tavrs a month what is your favorite vascular intervention how many do you do a year and what devices do like to use dr bacharach aortic endografting i performed 90 endografts last year when i was at cleveland i saw the initial endograft devices being developed i worked very hard to bring that technology to sioux falls and was one of the first interventional cardiologists to really take an interest in it i have used all of the current modular devices cook medtronic and gore and unibody devices they all work very well do you preferentially use any of them dr bacharach my father drove a ford he liked fords our neighbor liked chevrolets i can t tell you that any of them shines above and beyond there are some nuance differences such as supra renal fixation which the cook and medtronic devices have and the gore device does not i don t really see that as a drawback we currently do about 80% of our volume with the gore device what about newer devices such as afx endovascular aaa system endologix irvine california and ovation trivascular santa rosa california device dr bacharach the afx endovascular aaa system endologix irvine california is a useful unibody device when we employ snorkeling techniques to salvage the internal iliac arteries we will often use this gore has some new branch preserving devices that we are currently involved with in trials ovation prime trivascular santa rosa california is interesting we don t use it in the acute setting rupture but for short necks and other scenarios it is appealing do the caliber of the devices affect how you think about them and use them dr bacharach both the afx endovascular system and ovation prime are smaller and lend themselves to percutaneous strategies however i have used preclose technique for all of my endografts whether i go percutaneous is dictated more by common femoral artery anatomy if you are careful and use good technique you can use percutaneous techniques with all of them moving on to lower extremity interventions give us some insight into how you approach femoropopliteal occlusive disease dr bacharach if i can access antegrade i will i use a 6 french sheath and either an angled glidewire or an terumo advantage terumo medical corporation if i have gone extraluminal i will reenter with 0 014 cto wires or a v18 i am old school and really never use crossing devices perhaps this is because i am cost conscious i very rarely require a reentry tool but i use the outback when necessary do you believe in atherectomy dr bacharach not really i think of it like a niche device i found that with atherectomy i was getting similar restenosis as i did with stenting but i could place a stent in a fraction of the time so i rarely use atherectomy devices i reserve its use for specific anatomical locations isolated short popliteal artery segments that i am trying to avoid stenting or ostial profunda lesions in a patient with prior common femoral endarterectomy and profundaplasty would you describe yourself and a stenter or stent minimizer dr bacharach i am a stenter i am trying to get the best luminal result that i can at the initial presentation i balloon and stent i do not want to come back we used to see short segment sfa stenoses that responded well to balloon angioplasty but i just don t see those anymore that s not the patient population that i treat the pattern of disease seems to have changed i find myself looking after a sicker and older patient population with multi level more extensive disease when you stent what do you like to use dr bacharach for routine superficial femoral arteries arteries and longer lesions i have gone with mostly medtronic nitinol self expanding stents in terms of des i tend to use zilver ptx cook medical bloomington indiana in restenosis after seeing some of zeller s work i rarely use zilver ptx as a first stent there are a few other intriguing stents on the market the smart stent cordis bridgewater nj is interesting and easy to deploy i am still waiting to see how they fare in the long term the supera abbot vascular abbott park ilinois stent which i have been deploying for a few years now is very useful though there is a bit of a learning curve with the device there is a role for it when going across the adductor canal especially when i need to stent the above knee popliteal artery though i try to avoid the popliteal when at all possible do you enjoy critical limb ischemia dr bacharach not really i think of critical limb ischemia something i have to do part and parcel with providing a full service to patients patients with critical limb are challenging patients with a high recurrence rate and are often recalcitrant to medical therapy and risk factor modification overall i find critical limb to be professionally less satisfying than other areas of vascular intervention i don t shy away from it but i don t relish it either do you use pedal access when dr bacharach not frequently it is rare that i am not successful in an antegrade fashion however desperate measures must be taken by desperate men in general i am very conservative about pedal access i will only access the pedals after an antegrade attempt has failed once or twice maybe this happens a handful of times a year we used to do popliteal access but i have largely abandoned that because sheath management can be such a problem i have heard that you perform catheter directed lysis do you think the type of catheter matters dr bacharach no i don t what do you think crest ii will demonstrate dr bacharach crest ii will be difficult to recruit for i m also concerned about the stent arm since finding experienced operators maybe difficult compounded by the fact that many operators have such low volumes in the absence of registries what is your sense of the best trial dr bacharach best could be a very important trial however it will be dependent on centers in which both surgical and endovascular skill are equivalent what made you successful and good at what you do dr bacharach i was fortunate to have had wonderful training at the mayo and at cleveland i worked hard i was available and i was always very passionate about what i was doing large volume was very helpful it is like that old joke how do you get good judgment through experience how do you get experience by having bad judgment i made a lot of sacrifices i missed lots of soccer games what advice would you give to clinicians applying for positions in the field of vascular intervention dr bacharach many fellows are graduating with a wealth of experiences in their respective training programs but one has to realize that your training is never truly complete and that you are always evolving having the mindset that you are willing to ask for help is important coachability is key we are wary of applicants who are truly overconfident and come out pounding on their chest saying i want to do complex cases that is a red flag for us looking at the future of vascular intervention do you think the future is bleak or bright dr bacharach it depends on your mindset i think that it is bright for practitioners who are dedicated to vascular intervention and have demonstrated true interest and or expertise one has to be willing to see the swollen legs the blue digits and the odd vasculitidies the future might be bleaker for people coronary interventionalists who are solely interested in expanding their interventional volumes high volume centers don t really want people who dabble in vascular intervention one has to embrace vascular medicine in a more holistic way you have to carve out an area of expertise and be recognized by your referring practitioners as someone who takes care of people beyond the bread and butter of cardiovascular medicine with the right mindset the future is very bright this field is constantly changing and fascinating the level of change in vascular intervention has been monumental and has outpaced the advancements within coronary intervention over the past decade there will be challenges especially cost we have demonstrated that we can look after patients well but expensively can we do it cost effectively that will be a huge challenge for the interventionalists of the future overall i am high on the future of vascular intervention '),

 ('263', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' guideline recommendations in 2013 the us preventive services task force usptf updated its 2005 guidelines to state that there was insufficient evidence to support screening ankle brachial index measurement abi in asymptomatic adults regardless of age or risk factors grade i statement 1 this recommendation contradicted the endorsement made in the 2011 american college of cardiology foundation accf american heart association aha guidelines which recommended screening all adults over age 65 regardless of symptoms or risk profile and all adults over 50 with a history of either smoking of diabetes class i grade b 2 in addition the 2009 trans atlantic inter society consensus document on management of peripheral arterial disease tasc ii similar to the 2005 accf aha guidelines had advised screening all patients 70 years regardless of comorbidities and all patients 50 years of age with at least one risk factor why the disagreement especially over a test that has long been praised for its low cost and rapid point of care administration epidemiologic studies each committee highlighted different sources of evidence to justify their recommendations the 2011 accf aha guidelines updated their screening recommendations because of a single large observational study the german epidemiologic trial on ankle brachial index study group 3 this study enrolled 6880 unselected adults 65 years of age in germany all of whom were interviewed to assess for vascular disease and underwent resting abi with a cutoff of 0 90 patients were classified as having peripheral arterial disease pad if they were asymptomatic with an abnormal abi or symptomatic with a history of intervention or amputation with this case definition the study found that 21% of adults over the age of 65 had some form of pad of those 12 3% were asymptomatic and 8 7% symptomatic about a quarter of the symptomatic patients had undergone any intervention and symptomatic patients had a higher risk of vascular events but not overall mortality compared with asymptomatic patient but over 5 years of follow up asymptomatic patients with pad had a higher overall mortality than patients without pad 19 5 vs 41 7 patients per 1000 patient years hr 1 66 95% ci 1 38 2 00 a finding echoed in prior studies though this study was available to them at the time of writing the usptf did not reference the german epidemiologic trial instead the committee referenced the national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes which showed that only 5 9% of patients 40 years of age or 17 5% of patients over 75 had pad as defined solely by a low abi 0 90 a less sensitive case definition 4 benefits of early treatment the usptf paper stated we found no evidence that screening for and treatment of pad in asymptomtic patients leads to clinically important benefits it further suggested that while adding abis to the framingham risk score frs results in patient risk reclassification 19% of men and 26% of women there is uncertainty about improving clinical outcomes as a result of this adjustment 5 usptf primarily cites the aspirin for asymptomatic atherosclerosis trial which randomized 4941 asymptomatic patients with abi 0 95 to aspirin or placebo and found no significant benefit in cardiovascular outcomes myocardial infarction stroke or revascularization 6 on the other hand the accf aha guidelines recommended aggressive risk factor modification enhanced patient follow up and pharmacological therapy with emphasis on statin ib and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor acei iib treatment the heart protection study included 6748 patients with pad who did not have coronary disease those randomized to 40mg of simvastatin benefited from a significant 25% reduction in vascular events compared with placebo 7 based on this and other trials showing a comparable reduction in cv events the new 2013 acc aha cholesterol guidelines also recommended high intensity statin therapy in any patient with pad 8 discussion detecting the presence of pad is critical its diagnosis alters a patient s risk profile and will cause clinicians to follow patients more closely and have a heightened sensitivity to associated conditions especially concomitant coronary disease which is present in 60% of patients with pad 9 the diagnosis also helps the clinician emphasize important risk factor modification efforts such as tobacco cessation weight loss exercise and cholesterol management its presence may be the sole impetus to start a statin in addition distinguishing between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients can be challenging particularly in patients who do not exercise enough to produce symptoms 9 and thus screening elderly patients with a baseline risk of around 20% will likely identify both those patients who are truly asymptomatic as well as those who did not know they were symptomatic until they were actually tested take home message asymptomatic adults 65 years of age regardless of risk factors or 50 years of age with risk factors should be screened with a simple office based ankle brachial index study references 1 moyer

 ('265', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' peripheral artery disease or pad is defined by the presence of a stenosis or occlusion in the aorta or branch vessels which supply the lower extremities pad is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis the three cardinal manifestations of atherosclerosis are coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease and pad once a patient is diagnosed with pad they are at higher risk of suffering future mi stroke or death pad affects 8 12 million americans second only to coronary artery disease the prevalence of pad increases with age the national health and nutrition examination survey or nhanes found the prevalence of pad among patients age 40 years or older in the united states was 4 3% for patients age 70 or older the prevalence of pad was 14 5% the pad awareness risk and treatment new resources for survival program or partners program included patients either more than 70 years old or between 50 to 69 years old and with diabetes or a history of smoking when common risk factors were included in the population the prevalence of pad was approximately 29% or 1 3 of all patients smoking diabetes htn and elevated cholesterol are the strongest risk factors for developing pad gender differences in prevalence of pad according to one series of 6880 pts from 344 primary practices in germany from 2004 the prevalence of pad in females was greater than men in those 85 yrs of age 6 however according to pooled data from 6 registries over 24 000 pts pad prevalence was slightly higher in men within all age groups unfortunately published series are often marred by selection bias and many feel that the true burden of pad defined by abi 0 9 obtained from u s census 2010 data may be the most reliable indicator of disease prevalence in the u s in a study adopted by hirsch et al the burden of pad was higher in women over the age of 70 as compared to men unfortunately the diagnosis of pad represents the tip of the iceberg pad is a marker of systemic atherosclerosis a major predictor of future mi cva and death unfortunately few studies have reviewed potential gender specific mortality differences in pad in one study adapted from data collected by the abi collaboration study 480 325 person years 24 955 men and 23 339 women overall rates of cvd and mortality were similar in men and women however both major cv events and mortality were significantly increased in women as compared to men with more advanced disease abi 0 7 or 1 4 due to the limited data and awareness of pad in women the american heart association in collaboration with the vascular disease foundation and its peripheral arterial disease coalition commissioned the aha pad coalition to urge healthcare professionals to promptly establish pad in women at risk and to incorporate pad specific risk messages within current women s health clinics in an effort to raise community awareness summary points gender and age specific prevalence of pad has not been clearly defined from published population based studies although the age dependent prevalence of pad in adult women may be lower than men the total population burden of pad appears to be higher in women particularly in those over age of 70 all pts with pad are more likely to die from chd events than those without pad there is a trend towards higher cv mortality all cause mortality and major cv event

as claudication or the presense of pain aching fatigue or discomfort that occurs with exertion however studies have shown that most patients with pad are asymptomatic 50% or present with atypical

walking and leg circulation study walcs a cohort of 460 pad participants in the chicago area women were more than 2x s more likely to report the presence of atypical exertional leg symptoms that sometimes began at rest therefore the vast majority of patients with pad may be missed based on history and physical alone highlighting the importance of further screening for pad i e use of abi s in high risk populations and in particular women in fact the updated acc aha guidelines in 2011 suggest obtaining abi s in at risk populations defined by those who are 70 years and older or who are 50 years and older with a history of smoking or diabetes level of evidence 1b currently there are no known gender based differences in the diagnostic sensitvity or accuracy of the physiologic or classic image based diagnostic pad tests arterial diameters in women are smaller than age matched diameters in men and it is unclear if these anatomic differences may have some effect on gender specific treatment outcomes pad treatment in women the goals of pad treatment are two fold to improve the affected limb in presence of debilitating symptoms of critical limb ischemia and to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with pad limb related improvement can be assessed by improvement in walking ability and prevention of progression to cli and amputation decreases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality include decreased mortality from mi stroke and cardiovascular death as well as decreased risk of nonfatal mi and stroke although women with pad have greater functional impairment than men with pad women may be less likely to undergo lower extremity revascularization than men in one study by feinglass et al men were more than twice as likely to be selected

10% mortality rate traditionally a surgical consult and expectant management with transfusion required in 70 80% of cases were the mainstays of treatment recently the availability of a 24 hour angiography suite and peripheral vascular operators have changed the standard practice at many institutions though data are limited to small cohort series and case reports a case presented below will be used to provide context for a brief discussion following clinical vignette a 51 year old gentleman with a history of obesity sleep apnea and hypertension presented with chest pain since lifting a heavy object on the morning of presentation his initial troponin was 10 and he was taken for cardiac catheterization after loading with aspirin 162 mg clopidogrel 600 mg and heparin iv bolus culprit

spontaneous rph should be higher diagnosing retroperitoneal hemorrhage a two step approach retroperitoneal hematoma should be considered in any patient that is hemodynamically unstable after a transfemoral procedure the first step to making the diagnosis is a quick non contrast ct abdomen pelvis which may show soft tissue density compressing adjacent structures it should be noted however that if a patient is post procedure and unstable the right place to go is back to the cath lab and not to the ct suite going to the ct suite may result in loss of precious time once the presence of hematoma is confirmed by ct the patient should be taken immediately to the endovascular suite for localization and treatment of the source of bleeding as in the clinical vignette alternatively any patient showing signs of a retroperitoneal hematoma while still on the cath table should undergo femoral angiography at the access siteperforations can be managed with close observation as in appendix clinical vignette or immediate contralateral access and intervention endovascular therapy for a retroperitoneal hemorrhage options for endovascular repair are covered stent for iliac or femoral arteries or coil embolization for small vessel perforations in emergencies it is best to use whichever of these techniques is most readily available and familiar important considerations for stent graft placement include oversizing by 1 2 mm to ensure sealing avoiding the common femoral bifurcation and preparing for balloon occlusion in the common iliac if difficulties are encountered leading to a prolonged procedure in a rapidly decompensating patient when embolization is chosen coils should be deployed on both sides of a perforation to prevent re bleeding from dissection propagation or distal retrograde flow via abdominal collaterals when is surgery needed for the treatment of a retroperitoneal hemorrhage surgery may be necessary in cases where endovascular therapy fails and bleeding continues despite intervention in these cases direct visualization and ligation of the bleeding artery may be necessary with abdominal packing to prevent ongoing hemorrhage abdominal compartment syndrome can develop as the result of a large hematoma early surgery i e before trial of conservative treatment followed by angiography and intervention if necessary is frowned upon as removing a retroperitoneal hematoma may relieve tamponade and exacerbate bleeding it may also be difficult to localize the source of bleeding in the operating room whereas in the angiography or hybrid suite a perforation may be more readily visualized '),

 ('275', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' clinical vignette a 41 year old female presented to hospital with a swollen painful right upper extremity which had been progressive over several days the patient was an avid athlete who performed vigorous upper body exercised on a regular basis initial work up including upper extremity ultrasound confirmed right subclavian vein dvt figure 1 she had no personal or family history of thrombophilia and screening blood work was unremarkable chest x ray figure 2 did not show evidence of a cervical rib based on her presentation a discussion ensued with her physicians as to the best management ultimately given the time frame of the thrombus of which the acute episode appeared to be only several days time angiography with possible catheter direct thrombolysis cdt was offered to the patient angiography noted both acute and chronic features it confirmed 100% thrombotic occlusion of the subclavian vein at the level of the first rib figure 3 additionally there appeared to be collateralization which had formed allowing for drainage into the svc however given the acute presentation and progressive significant symptoms further intervention was attempted the lesion was crossed easily with an 0 035 stiff angled glide wire and an ekos catheter ekosonic endovascular was placed uneventfully with tpa infusing at 1mg hr overnight figure 4 this catheter combines a traditional lytic catheter with side holes with a tiny ultrasound filament which is postulated to assist in clot fragmentation the patient was also treated with adjunctive aspirin and heparin repeat angiography 24 hours later revealed some recanalization of the vessel and was treated with adjunctive angiojet therapy medrad and subsequent balloon angioplasty with a 9 40mm foxcross balloon abbott vascular final angiography revealed the vessel to be fully recanalized figures 5 7 the patient was then referred on to vascular surgery for consideration of rib resection in the setting of this current event approach to patients with effort thrombosis the issue of effort thrombosis arises from an anatomical abnormality of the thoracic outlet that predisposes patients to compression of the axillary and subclavian venous system this syndromes goes by various names including venous thoracic outlet syndrome paget schroetter syndrome spontaneous thrombosis of the upper extremity or effort thrombosis congenital features such as cervical rib extra muscle or abnormalities of tendon insertion may cause it secondary causes can include a fracture at the site or muscle hypertrophy from repetitive exercise ie rowing weight lifting pitching additionally extremes of motion or repetitive motion alone can create a nidus for this condition given this the presentation is most commonly seen in young athletic patients physical exam will be remarkable for swelling of the affected extremity however based on the chronicity of the process one may appreciate the formation of venous collaterals on the upper chest of the affected side urschel s sign depending on the severity of compression features of brachial plexus compression may also be present evaluation and examination should include careful assessment for the possibility of pulmonary embolism progressing from this condition as mentioned in the above vignette imaging is essential to the diagnosis of this condition cxr is helpful to rule out obvious anatomic causes however sometimes until the patient undergoes surgical exploration the immediate anatomic cause is not readily apparent vascular ultrasound is extremely helpful in solidifying this diagnosis with angiography still as the gold standard for assessment if no apparent anatomic cause is found then consideration of screening for thrombophilia or malignancy is warranted a departure from the guidelines given that this is a less common presentation of dvt there have been no randomized trials evaluating different treatment algorithms for this disorder leading much of the management to case reports and expert opinion 1 given the lack of high quality evidence based trials in this area the most recent acp chest guidelines still place anticoagulation alone as the strongest recommendation 2 however combining expert consensus case reports and the most current acp guidelines several hallmarks of treatment have been forwarded regardless of cause a minimum of 3 months of anticoagulation should be considered arm compression with an arm sleeve and elevation of the extremity may help with symptomatic relief if the acute presentation is felt to be less than 14 days old strong consideration should be given to catheter directed thrombolytic therapy an initial endovascular approach may include catheter directed lytic therapy percutaneous thrombectomy and balloon angioplasty but should not include stenting as an initial strategy until the mechanical obstruction is relieved the present of stent will increase the risk of rethrombosis surgical referral for removal of the mechanical issue which lead to the event in the current era there is evidence to suggest that if an aggressive approach to this condition is taken the incidence of post thrombotic syndrome may be decreased from 53% to 12 25% 3 given the lack of randomized clinical trials many areas of controversy remain regarding patient management including the true benefit of lytic therapy over heparin therapy whether or not adjunctive therapies such as ekos system and others have any additional benefit in this population the dose and duration of lytic therapy the timing of surgical decompressive therapy in hospital versus at 3 months post anticoagulation the best treatment of the affected vein post decompressive therapy stenting versus a surgical approach given these controversies this area remains rich for further study however current expert consensus recommends an aggressive strategy in this young active patient population it is hoped that future guidelines will seek to address a more unified consensus opinion than the current anticoagulation guidelines references illig ka doyle aj a comprehensive review of paget schroetter syndrome j vasc surg 2010 jun

 ('283', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' there is a need for more clinical trial data to facilitate medical decision making when caring for patients with critical limb ischemia cli traditionally outcome assessment in clinical trials for this patient population has focused on amputation free survival and patency choosing the optimal outcome that is important to patients with cli and their providers will be crucial in designing a valid and generalizable trial that adds meaningfully to the evidence base traditional outcomes amputation free survival is an unavoidably important hard outcome for trials of cli in fact major trials such as best are likely to be powered for this or a similar endpoint however limb therapies probably only affect the amputation component of this composite outcome as mortality in cli patients is often due to cardiac causes 1 in addition amputation free survival does not always correspond to a patient being ambulatory and living independently revascularization is a cornerstone in the management of patients with cli however patency another traditional outcome does not preclude limb salvage in a meta analysis of 30 studies 2557 patients with cli undergoing below knee revascularization 1 year patency following endovascular therapy was only 58 1 4 6% but limb salvage was 86 2 7% 2 as a corollary patency does not ensure the optimal clinical outcome in a series of 1012 patients undergoing infra inguinal bypass for cli 20% of those with patent grafts at 1 year remained symptomatic or had undergone amputation 3 though important for the clinical care of patients with critical limb ischemia lower extremity hemodynamics eg ankle brachial indices is a surrogate for patency in many respects functional outcomes after critical limb ischemia therapy treadmill testing protocols graded and constant load and 6 minute walk tests have been well studied in patients with claudication and also have good test characteristics 4 however is it reasonable to expect a patient with a painful wound that is appropriately dressed and offloaded to walk on a treadmill is loss of distance walked post intervention a treatment failure for a cli patient if that patient is still able to walk at all and live independently other functional tests are also being studied in patients with cli such as the summary performance score composite of 4 meter walk test balance test sit stand test vertical accelerometry and isometric muscle strength measurements 5 patient reported outcomes multiple patient reported outcomes have been studied in peripheral arterial disease some of these instruments are disease specific that is they were derived and validated in populations with peripheral artery disease examples include the walking impairment questionnaire the nottingham health profile padqol and vascuqol however no questionnaire has been designed specifically for cli patients excluding claudicants wound healing as an outcome of critical limb ischemia therapy wound healing is an important limb outcome for cli trials the definition of wound healing is typically a wound that remains healed for 2 weeks core labs exist for the assessment of wound healing the time to wound healing and the resources required to achieve wound healing revascularization procedures surgical debridements totality of wound care should be considered conclusions in conclusion there are challenges in choosing the optimal outcome assessment tools when designing a trial of cli therapies amputation free survival is likely to always be of interest refining the functional assessment of patients with cli with non walking functional tests such as those listed above may be of use developing a cli specific questionnaire that assesses quality of life and function would improve outcome assessment in this disease constructing an endpoint of limb health comprised of wound healing function and lack of pain would be of value when comparing therapies in cli patients
